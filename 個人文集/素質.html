`一條青蟲趴在枝幹上啃食葉子，下面哩哩啦啦掉出顆顆黑屎粒。陽光照在身上，洋洋愜意。
人問牠：「蟲子，你在幹什麼？」
蟲答：「活著。」頓了頓，又補了一句：「暫時活著。」
人豎起大拇指，嘆曰：「有水平！不愧是素食者，有素質！既然如此，我多問一句，為什麼活著？」
「嗯，大概，為了開心吧。」
「怎樣開心呢？」
「反正，有吃有喝、能吃能拉、邊吃邊拉、邊拉邊吃，吧。」
蟲子反問道：「你幹什麼？」
「念佛。」
「為什麼？」
「成佛。」
「為什麼？」
「回家。」
「在哪裏？」
「妙國。在彼岸。」
「怎麼妙？」
「妙不可言。真的，不是形容。非親歷不能知。」
「怎麼去呢？」
「移民。最方便的，投資移民。」
「怎麼投資？」
「念三年佛。」
「夠啦？我看有人念了三十年，怎麼還在此岸？」
「那人是花架子。真念不到三天，當然不行。」
「不見得哦。有人挺虔誠的，還是沒去成。」
「假如投資夠了，屆時有艄公來接引。但是你要能抓住祂的手才行；否則，一失足，又掉苦海裡了，爬回來，重新做蟲，再來一遍。」
「哦，不容易啊。」
「哪有那麼容易啊！我們燒香拜佛，就是為了消除業障、增長福報，同時祈求佛菩薩加被，增長信心。」
「聽說有人燒香拜佛，為的是得多一些葉子菓子、票子房子；有的甚至幹了壞事、心中害怕，求神靈保佑。」
「咳，現在的世道，什麼東西都有。要真懂才行啊。」
蟲子聽到這裡，一股渴求油然發生、從心而起，怯怯地問：「那，我能念佛嗎？」
「當然啊！太好啦！」
蟲子聞聽大喜，說：「我願意⋯⋯」餘話未完，蟲子「啪」地掉下，死了。原地驟然現出一個孩童，向那人跪求：「您教我念佛吧。」那人大感動，但誠心告言：「我沒有資格教你。推薦一個好老師，名叫『淨空法師』。聽他的沒錯。」「哪裡去找祂老人家呢？」「祂已經回家了，但是有很多視頻可以看。就像我們的佛祖釋迦摩尼佛，也回家了，給我們留下三藏十二部經典，我們可以慢慢學習。」
童子歡喜雀躍，作禮而去。`;

`A big fat worm perched on the vine, savoring the green leaves. Behind him, black droppings fell from time to time. He was warm and cozy, with the summer sun shining on him.
The man asked him, "Hey, worm, what are you doing?"
"Living," he replied. After a brief pause, he added, "Well, for the time being."
The man thumbed up and sighed, "Good worm! Impressive! No wonder a vegetarian, you have class! Ok, then, I like to pose another question. Why to live?"
"Well, perhaps, to be happy?"
"What constitutes happiness?"
"I don't know. If I have things to eat and drink, without any trouble, eating and pooing at will, isn't that not happiness?"
Then, the worm asked the man, "What do you do?"
"Chant Buddha's Name."
"Why?"
"To become Buddha."
"Why?"
"To return home."
"Where?"
"The Wonderland. On the other side."
"How wonderful?"
"Beyond words. Really, literally. You won't know without experiencing it in person."
"How to get there?"
"Immigrate. The most expedious way is to immigrate by investing."
"How to invest?"
"Chanting the Buddha's Name for three years."
"That's it? I have seen people chanting for thirty years, but still on this side, though."
"Some people think they are chanting Buddha's Name but in effect they are just feigning. That won't count."
"Not always. Some people are quite pious and diligent, yet still failed to trenscend to the other side."
"If the investment is enough, then a great Boatman will come to receive; but you must make sure to hold on to his hand, or else, you would slip back into the bitter sea; then you would climb back up, and start all over again."
"Oh, that doesn't sound easy."
"Of course not! This is such a serious matter, if you understand it well. That's why we work so hard, practically all our human lives, in order to accomplish the ultimate feat!
"I've heard some people practice Buddhistic worshipping in the hope of a better life on earth, or even atonement for their criminal acts."
"Yeah, nowadays, a lot of fake stuff, including fake Buddishim. You must know your trade well to be sure."
Hearing this, the worm suddenly had a warm urge wafting from inside. He asked the man, timidly, "Well, could I chant Buddha's Name?"
"Of course! That's wonderful!"
The worm was so happy, and said, "I would like to..." before finishing the sentence, he fell flat to the ground, and died. Right on the spot, emerged a boy; he knelt down and pleaded, "Dear sir, please teach me how to chant Buddha's Name." The man was so moved, and told the boy, "I am not qualified to teach you that. But I can recommend a good teacher, whose name is Master <i>Jing-Kong</i>. He is authentic and trustworthy." "Where can I find him?" "Unfortunately, He has returned home already. But he has left behind large quantity of videos and texts that you can study with. Just like our Supreme Teacher, Buddha Shakyamuni, who had showed up in this world and then returned home, leaving with us the whole corpus of Buddhism texts for us to study."
The child was hopping with joy. He saluted and went away.`;
