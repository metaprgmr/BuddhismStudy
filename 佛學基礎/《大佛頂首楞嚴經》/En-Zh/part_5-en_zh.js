{pt5 | The Enlightenment of Others}

{V6}

Ānanda adjusted his robe,
阿難整衣服，
brought his palms together
於大眾中合掌
and
[]
prostrated himself with his head
頂禮。
at the feet of the Buddha.
[]
He rejoiced at
@a@
his good understanding of the mind
心跡圓明，
@a@
悲欣交集。
and,
[]
for the benefit of coming generations,
欲益未來諸眾生故，
bowed again and said:
稽首白佛：
‘O great Compassionate
大悲
and
[]
World Honoured One,
世尊！
I have now awakened to
我今已悟
the
[]
Dharma gateway to Buddhahood
成佛法門，
by means of right practice
是中修行
about which
[]
I have no more doubt.
得無疑惑。
I have always heard the Buddha
常聞如來
speak of
說如是言。
Bodhisattvas
@a@
who,
[]
before their own liberation,
自未得度
set their minds on
@b@
freeing others,
先度人者，
@a@
菩薩
@b@
發心。
and of Buddhas who,
[]
after their own complete enlightenment,
自覺已圓
appeared in the world
[]
to enlighten others.
能覺他者，
Though

I am not yet liberated,
如來應世。我雖未度，

all living beings
一切眾生。

@c@

‘World Honoured One,
世尊。
future generations
此諸眾生，
will gradually move farther
[]
away from the Buddha
去佛漸遠。
and (will meet)

as many as the

如恒河沙。
In order

seats of study and learning

遠諸魔事。

avoid failure
@a@
(in their cultivation) of the mind set

on enlightenment?’
於菩提心
得無退屈。

爾時
The Buddha
世尊
praised Ānanda and said:
於大眾中，稱讚阿難。
‘Excellent, Ānanda, excellent,
善哉善哉。
(it is good that)

you ask about

the

reverently awaited
唯然
the (holy)

# Discipline & its Three Decisive Steps: Śīla, Dhyāna, & Prajna

The Buddha said:
佛告
‘Ānanda,
阿難。
you have
[]
always
汝常
heard me
聞我
teach about
[]
discipline (vinaya)
毗奈耶中，
which
[]
consists in
宣說
the
[]
practice of
修行
three decisive steps,
三決定義。
the
[]
control of mind,
所謂攝心
called
為
śīla
戒。
which
因戒
leads to
生
stillness (dhyāna)
定。
and
[]
thence
因定
to
發
wisdom (prajñā).
慧。
This is called
是則名為
the
[]
threefold
三
study of the supramundane way.
無漏學。

## Prohibition against carnality

‘Ānanda,
阿難。
why is
云何
control of mind
攝心
called śīla?
我名為戒。
If all living beings
若諸世界
in the six worlds
六道眾生，
of existence
[]
abstain from sexual desire,
其心不婬，
they
[]
will not be subject to
則不隨其
the
[]
continual round of
@a@
births and deaths.
生死
@a@
相續。
Your practice of Samādhi
汝修三昧，
should free you from defilements
本出塵勞。
but
[]
they cannot be eliminated
@b@
if your
[]
lustful mind
婬心
is not wiped out.
不除，
@b@
塵不可出。
Even
縱
after you have
[]
acquired such wisdom,
有多智，
if you fail to kill sensuality,
@c@
then
[]
when dhyāna manifests,
禪定現前。
@c@
如不斷婬，
you
[]
will fall into
必落
the
[]
way of demons
魔道。
in which
[]
their king takes the high,
上品魔王、
his male subjects the middle
中品魔民、
and
[]
his female subjects the low rank.
下品魔女。
These demons
彼等諸魔，
have their following
亦有徒眾。
and
[]
boast {214} of having
各各自謂
attained the Supreme Path.
成無上道。
After my nirvāṇa,
我滅度後
in the Dharma ending age,
末法之中，
these subjects of Māra
多此魔民，
will be found everywhere,
熾盛世間，
will encourage sensuality
廣行貪婬，
and will
[]
disguise
為
themselves as men of good counsel
[]
(kalyāṇamitras)
善知識，
and
[]
cause
令諸
living beings
眾生
to fall into
落
the
[]
pit of lust
愛見坑，
thereby
[]
missing
失
the
[]
Bodhi path.
菩提路。

‘You should teach
汝教
worldly men
世人
who practise
修
Samādhi
三摩地，
to cut off
先斷
their
[]
lustful minds
心婬，
at the very start. This is
[]
called
是名
the
[]
Buddha‘s
如來先佛世尊，
profound teaching of the
[]
first decisive deed.
第一決定清淨明誨。
Therefore,
是故
Ānanda,
阿難。
if carnality is not wiped out,
若不斷婬修禪定者，
the practice of dhyāna is like
[]
cooking gravel to make rice;
如蒸砂石，欲其成飯，
even if it is boiled
[]
for hundreds and thousands of aeons,
經百千劫
it will
[]
be only hot gravel.
祇名熱砂。
Why?
何以故？
Because
[]
instead of
此非
rice grains
飯本，
it contains
[]
only stones.
砂石成故。
If you set your lustful mind
汝以婬身，
on seeking the profound fruit of Buddhahood,
求佛妙果。
whatever you may realize
縱得妙悟，
will be carnal by nature.
皆是婬根。
If your root is lustful,
根本成婬，
you will have to
[]
transmigrate
輪轉
through three unhappy ways
三塗，
(to the hells of fire, blood and swords)
[]
from which you will not escape.
必不能出。
How then can you
@a@
find the way to
[]
cultivate the Tathāgata‘s nirvāṇa?
如來涅槃，
@a@
何路修證。
You should
必使
cut off
@b@
both the
[]
sensual body and mind
婬機身心
@b@
俱斷，
until
[]
even the very idea of doing so
斷性
ceases;
亦無，
only then
@c@
can you hope
[]
to seek the Buddha‘s Enlightenment.
於佛菩提
@c@
斯可希冀。
This teaching of mine
如我此說，
is that of the Buddha
名為佛說。
whereas
[]
any other one
不如此說，
is that of
即
evil demons
[]
(pāpiyān).
波旬說。

## Prohibition against killing

‘Ānanda,
阿難。
if living beings in the six worlds
又諸世界六道眾生，
of existence
[]
cease to kill,
其心不殺，
they
[]
will not be subject to
則不隨相
the continual round of
@a@
births {215} and deaths.
生死
@a@
續。
Your practice of Samādhi
汝修三昧，
should free you from defilernents
本出塵勞。
but
[]
if your murderous mind
殺心
is not cut off,
不除，
they cannot be eliminated.
塵不可出。
You may
[]
acquire much wisdom
縱有多智，
but
[]
if you fail to stop killing,
@b@
when dhyāna manifests,
禪定現前。
@b@
如不斷殺，
you
[]
will fall into
必落
the
[]
way of spirits,
神道。
in which the
[]
high rank is
上品之人，
attained by
為
the
[]
mighty ghost (preta),
大力鬼。
the
[]
middle one
中品
by flying yakṣas
則為飛行夜叉
and
[]
chief ghosts,
諸鬼帥等。
and the
[]
low one
下品
by earth-bound rākṣasas.
當為地行羅剎。
These have followers
彼諸鬼神亦有徒眾。
and
[]
boas that they have
各各自謂
attained the Supreme Path.
成無上道。
After my nirvāṇa,
我滅度後
in the Dharma ending age,
末法之中，
these ghosts will be found
多此鬼神，
throughout in the world,
熾盛世間，
and will
[]
boast of
自言
how they
[]
feed on flesh
食肉
which leads them to
[]
realize
得
Bodhi.
菩提路。
Ānanda,
阿難。
I permit
我令
the
[]
bhikṣus
比丘
to eat
食
only the
[]
five kinds of pure flesh
五淨肉。
which are
此肉皆
the
[]
product of
@a@
my transcendental power
我神力
of transformation
[]
@a@
化生，
and
[]
not of animal slaughter.
本無命根。
You, Brahman,
汝婆羅門，
live in
[]
a country where
地
vegetables do not grow
@b@
because it is
[]
too damp and hot
多蒸濕，
and because of
[]
all the gravel and rock.
加以砂石，
@b@
草菜不生。
I use
我以
my spiritual power
大悲神力所加，
of compassion
因大慈悲
to provide you with illusory meat
假名為肉，
to satisfy your appetite.
汝得其味。
How then,
奈何
after my nirvāṇa,
如來滅度之後，
can you
[]
eat the flesh of living beings
食眾生肉，
and so
[]
pretend to be
名為
my disciple?
釋子。
You should know that
汝等當知。
those who eat meat,
是食肉人，
though
縱
their minds may open
得心開
and
[]
realize
似
a semblance of Samādhi,
三摩地，
are but
皆
great rākṣasas
大羅剎，
who,
[]
after this life,
報終
will sink
必沈
back into the
[]
bitter ocean of saṃsāra
生死苦海，
and
[]
cannot be
非佛
my disciples.
弟子。
They will
如是之人，
kill and devour one another
相殺相吞，
ceaselessly;
相食未已，
how then can
云何
they escape from
是人得出
the
[]
three worlds
三界。
of existence? {216}
[]

‘In addition
[]
you should teach
汝教
worldly men
世人
who practise Samādhi
修三摩地，
not to kill.
次斷殺生。
This is called
是名
the
[]
Buddha‘s
如來先佛世尊，
profound teaching of
[]
the
[]
second decisive deed.
第二決定清淨明誨。
Therefore,
是故
Ānanda,
阿難。
if killing is not stopped,
若不斷殺
the
[]
practice of dhyāna-samādhi
修禪定者，
is like
譬如
shutting one‘s ears
有人自塞其耳，
while
[]
crying in the hope
高聲大叫，
that
[]
people will not hear
求人不聞，
one‘s voice,
[]
or like
此等名為
trying
[]
to hide
欲隱
something
[]
that is already exposed
彌露。
to full view.
[]
All bhikṣus who live purely
清淨比丘
and
及
all Bodhisattvas
諸菩薩，
always refrain even from
於歧路行，
walking on the grass;
不蹋生草，
how can
況
they agree to
[]
uproot it?
以手拔。
How then can those
云何
who practise
[]
great compassion
大悲，
feed on the flesh and blood
@a@
of living beings?
取諸眾生
@a@
血肉充食。
If bhikṣus
若諸比丘，
do not wear
不服
garments made of (Chinese)
[]
silk,
東方絲綿絹帛，
boots of local leather
及是此土靴履
and furs,
裘毳，
and refrain from consuming
[]
milk, cream and butter,
乳酪醍醐。
they
如是比丘，
will really
[]
be liberated from
@b@
the
[]
worldly;
於世真
@b@
脫，
after
[]
paying their former debts,
酬還宿債，
they will
[]
not transmigrate in the three realms
不遊三界。
of existence.
[]
Why?
何以故？
Because by
[]
using animal products,
服其身分，
one creates causes
皆為彼緣。
(which are always followed by effects), just like
[]
a man who eats
如人食其
cereals grown in the soil
地中百穀，
and whose
[]
feet cannot leave the ground.
足不離地。
If a man can (control)
(必使身心，)
his body and mind
(於諸眾生若身身分，)
and thereby
(身心二塗，)
@c@
不服
@d@
不食，
refrains from
[]
eating animal flesh
@d@
and
[]
wearing animal products,
@c@
I say
我說
he
是人
will really be liberated.
真解脫者。
This teaching of mine
如我此說，
is that of the Buddha
名為佛說。
whereas any other
不如此說，
is that of evil demons.
即波旬說。

## Prohibition against stealing

‘Further, Ānanda,

潛匿姦欺，
pose as men of good counsel
稱善知識。
and

declare
各自謂已
that they have

won the Superior Dharma
得上人法。
to deceive the ignorant
誘惑無識，
who will thus
[]
lose their minds;
恐令失心。
wherever they pass,
所過之處，
they will
[]
cause untold miseries
其家耗散。
to their believers.

‘This is why

阿難。
if lying is not stopped,
若不斷其大妄語者，
the practice of dhyāna-samādhi
[]
is like copying in excrement
如刻人糞
a sandalwood statue
為栴檀形，
and expecting it to be fragrant,
欲求香氣，
which is impossible.
無有是處。
I teach the bhikṣus
我教比丘
to develop
[]
a straightforward mind
直心
which is the temple of enlightenment
[]
(bodhimaṇḍala)
道場，
and
[]
to be righteous
@a@
in their common acts of daily life,
於四威儀一切行中，
@a@
尚無虛假。
while walking, standing, sitting and reclining.
[]
How can a liar
云何
pretend that he has realized the Supreme Dharma?
自稱得上人法。
This is like
譬如
a poor man proclaiming himself a king;
窮人妄號帝王，
he will only
[]
invite trouble and misfortune.
自取誅滅。
Still less
況復
@b@
法王，
can he usurp
如何妄竊。
the (throne of the)
[]
King of the Law.
@b@
If the
[]
causal ground is false,
因地不真，
its fruit will be distorted,
果招紆曲。
and the
[]
quest of Buddha‘s Enlightenment
求佛菩提，
[]
如噬臍人
will become impossible.
欲誰成就。

‘If a bhikṣu
若諸比丘，
(develops)
[]
a mind as straight as a lute-string
心如直絃，
and is
[]
truthful under all
一切真實，
circumstances, he will
[]
avoid,
@c@
in his
[]
practice of Samādhi,
入三摩地
@c@
永無
all troubles caused by the demon.
魔事。
I
我
will seal
印
his realization of
是人成就
the Bodhisattva‘s Supreme Bodhi.
菩薩無上知覺。
This teaching of mine
如我所說，
is that of the Buddha
名為佛說。
whereas
[]
any other one
不如此說，
is that of evil demons.‘ {221}
即波旬說。
