# The Meditative Study of All as Unreal (Samāpatti)
## The One Mind Being the Source of Both Delusion & Enlightenment

[]
‘爾時
Pūrṇamaitrāyaṇīputra,
富樓那彌多羅尼子，
who was in the assembly,
在大眾中，
rose from his seat,
即從座起。
uncovered his right shoulder,
偏袒右肩，
knelt upon his right knee,
右膝著地，
reverently joined the palms of his hands
合掌恭敬
and 
[]
said to the Buddha:
而白佛言：
‘O August and 
大威德 
World Honoured One,
世尊。
you have revealed 
[]
the Tathāgata‘s profound meaning 
@a@
so well to all living beings.
善為眾生敷演
@a@
如來第一義諦。
The Buddha 
世尊
has always declared 
常推
that
[]
@b@
說法人中，
I surpass 
我為第一。
all men in preaching the Dharma,
@b@
but as 
[]
I now listen to 
今聞
His melodious and deep Dharma voice,
如來微妙法音，
I am like 
猶如
a deaf man
聾人，
(striving to)
[]
hear flies and mosquitoes 
@c@
a hundred feet away;
逾百步外，
@c@
聆於蚊蚋，
he cannot see,
本所不見，
still less 
何況
can he hear them.
得聞。
In spite of what the Buddha taught
佛雖宣明，
to cut off our delusion,
令我除惑，
I fail to understand
今猶未詳
its ultimate meaning
斯義究竟，
which is altogether beyond me.
無疑惑地。
World Honoured One,
世尊，
(it is reasonable that)
[]
those like Ānanda
如阿難輩，
who have 
[]
merely opened their minds
雖則開悟，
but 
[]
have not cast away their worldly habits,
習漏未除。
do not understand it,
[]
but though 
[]
I (and others here) 
我等會中
have reached 
登
the state 
[]
beyond the stream of transmigration,
無漏者， (雖盡諸漏，)
we are still 
[]
not quite clear about 
@d@
the Dharma (just) 
今聞如來
taught by the Tathāgata.
所說法音，
@d@
尚紆疑悔。

‘World Honoured One,
世尊。
if all things (such as)
若復世間一切
the sense organs and data,
根
aggregates,
塵
entrances 
陰
and
[]
fields of sense
處界等，
are 
皆
fundamentally the pure and clean 
@a@
Tathāgata store,
如來藏
@a@
清淨本然。
why does
云何
the latter
[]
suddenly
忽
create
生
mountains,
山
rivers,
河
the great world
大地
and 
[]
all other forms
諸有為相。
that rise and fall in turn 
@b@
without interruption? {124}
次第遷流，
@b@
終而復始。

‘The Tathāgata has also 
又如來
spoken of
說，
(the elements of)
[]
earth,
地
water,
水
fire 
火
and
[]
wind
風，
whose natures mix
本性圓融，
and 
[]
pervade 
周遍
the whole Dharma realm
法界，
in which 
[]
they remain all the time.
湛然常住。
World Honoured One,
世尊。
if the element of earth 
若地性
was all-embracing
遍，
how could 
云何
it contain 
容
the element of waters
水。
if the latter 
水性
was all-pervading,
周遍，
there would be 
[]
no fire,
火則不生。
then 
[]
how can 
[]
one be clear that
復云何明
these two elements
水火二性
pervade 
俱遍
all space
虛空，
without 
不相
destroying each other?
陵滅。
World Honoured One,
世尊。
the nature of earth 
地性
is obstructive
障礙，
while 
[]
that of space 
空性
is the reverse;
虛通，
how can
云何
both of them 
二俱
pervade 
周遍
the whole Dharma realm?
法界。
I really do not 
而我不知
understand.
是義攸往。
May the Tathāgata be compassionate enough
惟願如來，
to enlighten me
宣流大慈，
and so 
[]
dispel the clouds of my delusion?’
開我迷雲，
[]
及諸大眾。

After saying this,
作是語已，
he prostrated
五體投地，
and eagerly awaited
欽渴
the holy teaching.
如來無上慈誨。

The Buddha said to
(爾時)世尊告
Pūrṇamaitrāyaṇīputra
富樓那，
and
及
all arhats 
@a@
in the assembly 
諸會中
@b@
漏盡無學
@a@
諸阿羅漢：
who had reached the state 
[]
beyond samsaric transmigration 
@b@
and beyond further study:
@b@
‘The Tathāgata now
如來今日
[]
普為此會，
expounds 
宣勝義中
the highest transcendental Truth
真勝義性。
so that 
[]
those hearers with settled minds
令汝會中定性聲聞，

及

who have 
諸一切
not yet realized that 
未得
neither ego nor dharma exist

seek Reality,

阿羅漢等，

the passionlessness of 
一乘寂滅場地，
the Supreme Vehicle.
真阿練若，
@d@
正修行處。
Listen attentively 
汝今諦聽，
to what I say.’
當為汝說。

Pūrṇamaitrāyaṇīputra 
富樓那
and 
[]
the assembly 
等，
kept silent awaiting 
@a@
with reverence 
欽
the Buddha‘s Dharma voice.
佛法音，
@a@
默然承聽。

The Buddha asked:
佛言。
‘Pūrṇamaitrāyaṇīputra,
富樓那。
you now ask why
如汝所言，
that which is 
[]
fundamentally pure and clean
清淨本然，
suddenly created
云何忽生
mountains,
山
rivers and
河
the great earth,
大地。
but have {125} you not heard
汝常不聞
the Buddha declare that
如來宣說，
(self-) 
[]
natured Bodhi 
性覺
is absolute and enlightened
妙明，
and that 
[]
basic Bodhi 
本覺
is enlightened and absolute?’
明妙。

Pūrṇamaitrāyaṇīputra 
富樓那
replied: ‘Yes,
言。唯然，
World Honoured One,
世尊。
I have heard 
我常聞
[]
佛宣說
this.’
斯義。

## A Probe into the Disciple’s Understanding of Noumenon & Phenomenon to Reveal the Rise of Illusions

The Buddha asked:
佛言，
‘When you speak of Bodhi
汝稱覺
and 
[]
Enlightenment,
明，
do you mean that 
[]
because of its 
為復
enlightened nature,
性明，
you call it 
稱名為
Bodhi,
覺。
or because of its 
為
(basic) 
[]
unenlightened nature,
覺不明，
you (now) 
[]
call it 
稱為
enlightened Bodhi?’
明覺。

## The Real Missed by Cognizance of the False

Pūrṇamaitrāyaṇīputra 
富樓那
said:
言。
‘If 
若
that which is unenlightened 
此不明
is called Bodhi,
名為覺者，
it is 
則
not aware of anything.‘ {126}
無所明。

## The Three Finer Conditions of Unenlightenment (Basic Ignorance: Subject & Object)

The Buddha 
佛
said:
言。
‘You say that “that which 
[]
is not aware of anything
若無所明，
is not 
則無
enlightened Bodhi,”
明覺。
but that which 
[]
creates an illusory object 
有所非覺，
is unenlightened
無所非明。
and that which abstains from so doing is free from (subjective) awareness.
[]
The unenlightened
無明
is 
[]
(certainly)
又
not the clean nature of Bodhi,
非覺湛明性。
for (self-) 
[]
natured Bodhi 
性覺
is essentially enlightened
必明，
but 
[]
is mistaken for 
妄為
enlightened awareness.
明覺。
Bodhi is not 
覺非
(that) 
[]
awareness of things
所明。
for such awareness 
因明
sets up objects,
立所。
and 
所
the setting up of illusory objects
既妄立，
implies 
生
an illusory subject.
汝妄能。


## The Six Coarser Conditions of Unenlightenment

‘Thus 
[]
from 
@a@
that which was 
[]
beyond both identity
無同異
@a@
中，
and diversity 
[]
arose all differences.
熾然成異。
When the differentiating subject 
異彼
confronted its differentiated objects,
所異，
the resultant diversity 
因異
led to identification.
立同。
Identity 
同
and 
[]
diversity 
異
further led to {127}
發明，
that which was 
(因此復立)
neither the same 
無同
nor different.
無異。
These 
如是
conflicting disturbances
擾亂，
resulted in troubled 
@a@
(perception) 
[]
which in time 
相待
@a@
生勞。
gave rise to objective form.
(勞久)發塵，
Self-created confusion,
自相渾濁。
caused by clinging to names,
[]
caused 
由是引起
karmic activity and so 
[]
suffering.
塵勞煩惱。
Thus 
[]
that which manifested
起
became 
為
the (changing) 
[]
world
世界。
and 
[]
that which was still 
靜
was space.
成虛空。
Hence 
[]
space 
虛空
stands for 
為
identity
同。
and 
[]
the world 
世界
for
為
diversity,
異。
and that which is 
[]
neither the same 
彼無
nor different 
同異，
is a 
真
living 
有為
being.
法。

## The Law of Continuity
### Continuity of the (physical) universe

‘Sustained 
[]
confrontation of 
@a@
(subjective) 
[]
awareness 
覺
with (objective) 
[]
@a@
明
dim voidness
空昧，
produced vibration and movement;
相待成搖，
hence 
故有
the wheel of wind
風輪
in constant motion 
[]
in the {128} universe.
執持世界。
Awareness so 
[]
shaken by the void,
因空生搖，
was benumbed by it
堅明立礙，
and 
(彼金寶者，) 
[]
明覺
hardened 
立堅，
into the (element of) metal;
[]
hence 
故有
the wheel of metal
金輪
to preserve the earth.
保持國土，
[]
堅覺寶成。
When 
[]
the movement 
@b@
caused by 
[]
awareness
@b@
@b@
搖明
produced wind
風出，
the friction between wind and metal
風金相摩，
flashed fire,
故有火光，
the nature 
為
of which was 
[]
transformative.
變化性。
Fire sprang up 
@c@
and 
[]
melted metal;
寶明生潤，
@c@
火光上蒸，
hence the wheel of water
故有水輪
pervades all 
含
the worlds in the ten directions.
十方界。
The meeting of 
@d@
rising fire 
火騰
with 
[]
falling water,
水降，
@d@
交發
formed 
立堅，
wet oceans
濕為巨海，
and 
[]
dry continents.
乾為洲潬。
This is why
以是義故，
fire (sometimes) rises 
@e@
from the bottom of the seas,
彼大海中
@e@
火光常起，
and 
[]
streams and rivers flow 
@f@
over continents.
彼洲潬中
@f@
江河常注。
Excess of water 
水勢
over fire
劣火，
resulted in 
結為
(the formation of) 
[]
high mountains;
高山。
hence
是故
rock
山石，
sparks when struck
擊則成燄，
and 
[]
melts 
融則成水。
when submitted to great enough heat.
[]
An excess of earth 
土勢
over water
劣水，
resulted in 
抽為
the growth of vegetation;
草木，
hence
是故
a forest fire 
林藪遇燒
reduces the trees to earth,
成土，
and 
[]
a plant bleeds 
@g@
when twisted.
因絞
@g@
成水。
Thus
[]
these illusory (four wheels) intermingled
交妄發生，
and 
[]
became mutual seeds
遞相為種。
to ensure
以是因緣，
the continuity of the world.
世界相續。

### Continuity of living beings

‘Further,
復次
Pūrṇamaitrāyaṇīputra,
富樓那。
this defect in awareness
明妄
[]
非他，
was caused by its subjectiveness
覺明為咎。
that 
[]
set up illusory objects 
所妄既立，
beyond which

不踰。

and 
[]

不超

The six illusory sense data, 
@a@
thus created, 
@a@
divided (the undivided nature) into

@a@
六妄成就。
As a result 
由是(分開)

同業

相纏，
whereas dissimilarity led to

either union 
合

[]

‘When 
[]
the perception of

@a@
an (illusory)

Thus

羯羅藍遏蒲曇等。
Therefore,

the four forms of birth

derive from particular causes;

birth from an egg

以合感。

The union and parting of 
@a@

cause further changes 
更相變
and

which 
[]
rise and fall, 
@b@
closely followed by living beings who are thus subject to the retributive 
[]
effects of their karma.
所有受業，
@b@
逐其飛沈。
Hence the continuity of (the realm of) living beings. {130}
以是因緣，眾生相續。

### Continuity of karmic retribution

‘Pūrṇamaitrāyaṇīputra,
富樓那。
since 
[]
desire and love are tied 
想愛同結，
so closely together,
[]
no disengagement 
愛
is possible
不能離，
and the result is 
(則諸世間)
an endless succession of 
@a@
the births of 
[]
parents, 
父母
children 
子
and 
[]
grandchildren.
孫，
@a@
相生不斷，
This comes mainly from
是等則以
(sexual) desire 
欲貪為本。
which is stimulated by love.
[]

‘Since 
[]
passion cannot be destroyed,
貪愛同滋，貪不能此，
living beings 
則諸世間
born from
[]
wombs,
胎
eggs,
卵
humidity 
濕
and
[]
by transformation
化
tend to 
[]
use their strength
隨力強弱，
to kill each other 
遞相
for food.
吞食，
This comes mainly from 
是等則以
their passion for killing.
殺貪為本。

‘So if 
以
a man 
人
(kills a sheep to) 
[]
eat its meat,
食羊，
the sheep 
羊
will be reborn as 
死為
a human being
人，
and the 
[]
man, 
人
after his death, 
死
will be reborn 
為
a sheep
羊，
(to repay his former debt).
[]

Thus 
[]
living beings of 
如是乃至
the ten states of birth,
十生之類，
[]
死死生生，
devour each other
互來相噉，
and so 
[]
form evil karma
惡業俱生，
which will 
[]
have no end.
窮未來際，
This comes mainly from 
是等則以
their passion for stealing.
盜貪為本。

‘Due to such causes as
[]
“you owe me 
汝負
my life”
我命，
and 
[]
“I pay 
我還
my debt,”
汝債，
living beings 
(以是因緣，)
are subject to birth and death 
@a@
for hundreds and thousands of aeons.
經百千劫，
@a@
常在生死。
Due to such causes as
[]
“you treasure 
汝愛
my heart,
我心，
I love 
我憐

汝色，
they continue to be

tied to each other

## The Uncreated & Unending

‘Pūrṇamaitrāyaṇīputra asked:
富樓那言：
‘If Bodhi,
若此妙覺
which is 
[]
basically 
本
absolute and enlightened
妙覺明，
and is 
[]
the same as the unchanging

不增不減。
can suddenly 
無狀忽
create

大地

other phenomena,
諸有為相。
when will 
[]
the Buddha, 
如來
who has attained Absolute Enlightenment,
今得妙空明覺，
again give rise to 
@b@
the worldly perception of 
@c@
mountains, 
山
rivers 
河
and 
[]
the great earth?’
大地，
@c@
有為習漏，
@b@
何當復生。

The Buddha 
佛
said: 
告
‘Pūrṇamaitrāyaṇīputra,
富樓那。
if a man loses his way
譬如迷人，
to a village
於一聚落，
by mistaking 
惑
south for north,
南為北，
does his error come 
此迷為復
from delusion
因迷而有，
or enlightenment?’
因悟所出。

Pūrṇamaitrāyaṇīputra 
富樓那
replied:
言：
[]
如是迷人，
‘From neither.
亦不因迷，又不因悟。
Why?
何以故？
Because, 
[]
since delusion 
迷本
has no root
無根，
how can 
云何
this error 
[]
come from it?
因迷。
Since 
[]
enlightenment 
悟
does not beget delusion,
非生迷，
how can it 
云何
cause him to err?’
因悟。

The Buddha asked:
佛言：
‘If this man,
彼之迷人，
while erring,
正在迷時。
suddenly meets 
焂有
someone 
悟人
who shows him 
指示
the right way,
令悟。
[]
富樓那。
do you think
於意云何。
in spite of his mistake,
此人縱迷，
he will lose his way again?’
於此聚落，更生迷不。

(Pūrṇamaitrāyaṇīputra replied:)
[]
‘No,
不也
World Honoured One.‘ {132}
世尊。

(The Buddha said:)
[]
‘Pūrṇamaitrāyaṇīputra,
富樓那。
it is the same with 
@a@
all Buddhas in the ten directions.
十方如來
@a@
亦復如是。
Delusion 
此迷
has no root
無本，
for it 
[]
has no self-nature.
性畢竟空。
Fundamentally 
昔本
there has 
[]
never been delusion
無迷，
and though 
[]
there is some 
似有
semblance of it,
迷覺。
when one is awakened,
覺迷
it vanishes 
迷滅，
(for) 
[]
Bodhi 
覺
does not beget it.
不生迷。
This is like 
亦如
a man suffering from an optical illusion
翳人
who sees flowers in the sky;
見空中華，
if he is cured,
翳病若除，
these flowers 
華
will disappear.
於空滅。
But if he 
(忽有愚人，)
[]
於彼空華所滅空地，
waits for them 
待華
to appear again,
更生。
do you call him 
汝觀是人
stupid 
為愚
or 
[]
intelligent?’
為慧。

Pūrṇamaitrāyaṇīputra 
富樓那
replied:
言：
‘Fundamentally space 
空元
has no flowers
無華，
but 
[]
due to defective sight 
妄見
they are seen as 
[]
being in the void;
生滅。
this is already 
見華滅空，
a false attitude.
已是顛倒，
If in addition, they are required 
[]
to appear again,
敕令更出，
this is 
斯
mere folly;
實狂癡。
how then can 
云何
that man be called
更名如是狂人
stupid 
為愚
or 
[]
intelligent?’
為慧。

The Buddha said:
佛言：
‘Since 
[]
you have interpreted well
如汝所解，
the non-existence of flowers in the sky,
[]
why do you still 
云何
ask me about
問言
the immaterial absolute Bodhi 
@a@
of all Buddhas
諸佛如來
@a@
妙覺明空，
creating
何當更出
mountains,
山
rivers 
河
and

the great earth?
大地。
It is like 
又如
ore 
金礦
which 
[]
contains pure gold;
雜於精金。
once 
[]
the latter is extracted,
其金一純，
it cannot be mixed 
更不成雜。
with the ore again.

It is also like 
如
the ashes of burnt wood

不重為木。
It is the same with

## The Unhindered Intermingling of Noumenon & Phenomenon

‘Pūrṇamaitrāyaṇīputra,
富樓那。
you now ask about
又汝問言：
the elements of
[]
earth,
地
water,
水
fire 
火
and
[]
wind
風，
which 
[]
fundamentally intermingle
本性圓融，
without hindrance 
周遍
in the Dharma realm;
法界。
you are 
[]
in doubt {133} 
疑
about why 
[]
the elements of water 
水
and 
[]
fire 
火性
do not destroy each other
不相陵滅。
and how 
又徵
the elements of space 
虛空
and 
及
earth 
諸大地，
can 
俱遍法界，
contain each other.
不合相容。

‘Pūrṇamaitrāyaṇīputra,
富樓那。
take for instance
譬如
space
虛空，
which 
[]
differs greatly 
體非
from all forms
群相，
but which 
而
does not prevent 
不拒
them from manifesting 
彼諸相發揮。
in it.
[]
Why?
所以者何。
[]
富樓那。
Because 
[]
space is
彼太虛空，
radiant in the sun
日照則明，
and 
[]
dark when 
@a@
the sky is cloudy,
雲屯
@a@
則暗，
it moves with the wind,
風搖則動，
is bright 
@b@
in a clear sky,
霽澄
@b@
則清，
hazy 
@c@
in a mist,
氣凝
@c@
則濁，
obscure 
@d@
in a dust-storm
土積
@d@
成霾，
and 
[]
is reflected 
@e@
when above clear water.
水澄
@e@
成映。
Do you think that
於意云何。
these transient 
如是殊方
forms in different places
諸有為相，
are created by these conditions
為因彼生，
or 
為
that they 
[]
come from space?
復空有。
If 
若
they come from these conditions,
彼所生，
then, 
富樓那。
when the sun shines,
且日照時，
there is sunlight
既是日明，
and 
[]
all the worlds in the ten directions
十方世界
should be 
[]
identical with the sun;
同為日色，
then 
[]
why is 
云何
the sun seen in the sky?
空中更見圓日。
If 
若
space shines,
是空明，
it should shine upon itself;
空應自照，
why then 
云何
at night
中宵，
or 
[]
when there are clouds and fog,
雲霧之時，
is there no light?
不生光耀。
Light therefore is
當知是明，
neither the same as
非日非空，
nor different from 
不異
the sun and space.
空日。

‘Thus when 
[]
looked into,
觀相
essentially 
元
there are 
[]
no forms
妄，
(i.e. the seven elements) for they 
[]
cannot be pointed out,
無可指陳。
like 
猶
unreal flowers in the sky
邀空華，
that can 
[]
only produce unreal fruit;
結為空果。
so 
[]
why do you 
云何
inquire about their 
詰其
mutual destruction?
相陵滅義。
But when 
[]
@a@
觀
their (underlying) 
[]
nature 
性元真，
is looked into,
@a@
it is fundamentally real for 
[]
it is 
唯
absolute Bodhi.
妙覺明。
Since 
[]
this absolute enlightened Mind
妙覺明心，
is basically 
先
neither water 
非水
nor fire,
火。
why do 
云何
you question
復問
their mutual hindrance?
不相容者。
Within this 
[]
true and absolute Bodhi Enlightenment,
真妙覺明
[]
亦復如是。
if you give rise to 
汝以
(the karmic illusion of) 
[]
space, 
空明，
space will manifest.
則有空現。
If you have (similar {134} illusions of)
[]
earth,
地
water,
水
fire 
火
and
[]
wind
風，
one after another,
各各發明，
they will 
[]
manifest separately
則各各現。
and 
[]
if 
若
you give rise to them all,
俱發明，
they will 
[]
appear simultaneously.
則有俱現。
what does 
云何
“simultaneous appearance” 
俱現。
mean?
[]
Pūrṇamaitrāyaṇīputra,
富樓那。
[]
如一水中現於日影。
If two men 
兩人
walking in opposite directions 
@b@
see 
同觀
the sun reflected in water,
水中之日，
@b@
東西各行，
each 
則各
will see 
有
the reflection 
日
follow 
隨
in his direction.
二人去。
There is 
[]
no fixed standard here
一東一西，先無準的。
and 
[]
you cannot query
不應難言，
why 
@c@
one sun can
此日是一，
@c@
云何
move in opposite directions
各行。
or 
[]
why 
@d@
two suns are seen
各日既雙，
@d@
云何
when 
[]
only one appears 
現一。
(in the sky)
[]
thereby 
[]
deepening 
宛轉
your delusion
虛妄，
without any prop on 
無可
which to hold.
憑據。


## Expounding the Common Source of Delusion & Enlightenment to Sum Up the Intermingling of Phenomenon & Noumenon

‘Pūrṇamaitrāyaṇīputra,
富樓那。
because 
[]
you cling to 
汝以
form and space
色空
that 
[]
displace each other 
相傾相奪
in the Tathāgata store,
於如來藏。
the latter 
而如來藏
in accordance with your karma, 
隨
manifests as 
為
space and form
色空。
which 
[]
pervade 
周遍
the whole Dharma realm,
法界。
and as a result,
[]
there appear within it
是故於中，
the blowing wind,
風動
still voidness,
空澄，
a bright sun 
日明
and
[]
dark clouds.
雲暗，
Due to 
[]
@a@
眾生
their delusion 
迷
and perplexity,
悶，
living beings 
@a@
turn their backs on Bodhi 
背覺
and 
[]
cling to sense objects
合塵，
thereby 
故
giving rise to 
發
troubles 
塵勞，
(kleśa) with the resultant appearance 
[]
of illusory forms.
有世間相。

‘(As to me), my 
我以
uncreated and unending profound enlightenment 
妙明不滅不生
accords with 
合
the Tathāgata store
如來藏。
which is 
而
absoute {135} Bodhi, 
如來藏，
and 
[]
ensures my perfect insight 
唯妙覺明，
into 
圓照
the Dharma realm
法界。
where 
是故於中，
the one is infinite 
一為無量，
and 
[]
the infinite is one;
無量為一。
where 
[]
the large manifests 
@b@
in the small
小中
@b@
現大，
and vice-versa;
大中現小。
where 
[]
the immovable bodhimaṇḍala 
不動道場，
appears 
遍
everywhere;
十方界。
where 
[]
my body embraces 
身含
the ten directions 
十方

無盡虛空。
where

@c@
於一毛端
the kingdom of treasures

on the tip of a hair;
@c@
and where

I sit in a speck of dust 
坐微塵裏
to turn the wheel of the Dharma.
轉大法輪。
As I have
