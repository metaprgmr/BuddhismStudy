# Objects Contemplated in Meditative Studies

After
[]
hearing the Buddha‘s teaching,
@a@
Ānanda and the assembly,
阿難及諸大眾，
@a@
聞佛示誨，
now rid of doubt and illusion,
疑惑銷除，
awoke to Reality
心悟實相。
and felt a lightness of body and mind
身意輕安，
which they had never experienced before.
得未曾有。
Ānanda again wept,
重復悲淚，
prostrated himself with his head
頂禮
at the feet of the Buddha,
佛足，
knelt down,
長跪
brought his palms together
合掌
and said:
而白佛言：
‘O peerless,
無上
compassionate
大悲
and
[]
immaculate
清淨
King of Treasures,
寶王，
you have
[]
opened my mind so well
善開我心。
by using
能以如是
all kinds of expedients
種種因緣，
and
[]
encouragement
方便提獎，
to lead me
[]
out of darkness
引諸沈冥
in the ocean of suffering.
出於苦海。
World Honoured One,
世尊。
after hearing your Dharma-voice,
我今雖承如是法音，
although I have realized
知
that
[]
the Bright Mind of Absolute Bodhi of
@b@
the Tathāgata store
如來藏
@b@
妙覺明心
pervades the ten directions
遍十方界，
to bring all the lands therein
含育如來十方國土，
to the pure and majestic
清淨寶嚴
kingdom of Absolute Enlightenment,
妙覺王剎。
the Buddha
如來
again
復
blames my useless knowledge
責多聞無功，
acquired by listening which
[]
cannot compare with
不逮
true practice and training.
修習。
I am like a traveller
我今猶如旅泊之人，
who is
[]
suddenly
忽
given by the king of heaven
蒙天王賜與
a splendid mansion,
華屋，
which
[]
now that
雖
he owns it,
獲大宅，
he should know
要因
how to enter.
門入。
May the Tathāgata
惟願如來
not forsake His great compassion
不捨大悲，
and
[]
may He teach all
示
the deluded in this assembly
我在會諸蒙暗者，
how to give up
捐捨
the Small Vehicle
小乘，
and
[]
@a@
畢獲如來無餘涅槃
how to develop their minds in order to
本發心路。
attain to Ultimate Nirvāṇa,
@a@
so that
令
those who still
[]
need study and learning
有學者，
may know how to
[]
overcome
從何攝伏
their clinging to causal phenomena
疇昔攀緣，
in order to
[]
achieve
得
perfect control
陀羅尼，
(dhāraṇī) and
[]
enter
入
the Buddha‘s All-wisdom.‘ {146}
佛知見。

After saying this,
作是語已，
he prostrated himself
五體投地。
and
[]
reverently awaited
在會一心，
the holy Teaching.
佇佛慈旨。

[]
爾時
The Buddha
世尊，
took pity on
哀愍
@a@
會中
the śrāvakas
緣覺
and
[]
pratyeka-buddhas
聲聞，
in the assembly
@a@
whose
[]
minds set on enlightenment
於菩提心
were
[]
still not at ease
未自在者。
and
[]
(also)
及
on future living beings
為當來佛滅度後，
in the Dharma ending age
末法眾生
who will want to
[]
develop
發
their Bodhi minds
菩提心，
and
[]
to tread the Path of the Supreme Vehicle.
開無上乘妙修行路。
He said to
宣示
Ānanda and the assembly:
阿難及諸大眾。
‘As you are determined to
汝等決定
develop the Bodhi mind
發菩提心，
and
[]
practise the Tathāgata‘s
於佛如來妙
Samādhi
三摩提，
tirelessly,
不生疲倦。
you should
應當
first ascertain
先明發覺
the
[]
two decisive factors
初心二決定義。
in the development of your mind.
[]

What are they?
云何初心二義決定。

## The subjective mind in the meditation

‘Ānanda,
阿難。
[]
第一義者，
as you decide to
汝等若欲
give up the state of a srāvaka
捐捨聲聞，
to practise
修
with the Bodhisattva Vehicle
菩薩乘入佛知見，
you should
應當
see clearly
審觀
if the cause-ground
因地發心，
(used as) a point of departure and
[]
its fruit-ground
與果地覺
(i.e. realization) are
[]
compatible
為同
or not.
為異。
Ānanda,
阿難。
if you use
以
your worldly mind
生滅心
[]
若於因地
as a causal point of departure,
為本修因，
you will fail
@a@
in your search for
而求
the Buddha Vehicle
佛乘
which is
[]
beyond birth and death.
不生不滅，
@a@
無有是處。
Therefore,
以是義故，
you should
汝當
inquire into
[]
all the creations
照明諸器世間可作之法，
(of the mind) which in this material world
[]
are subject to change and destruction.
皆從變滅。
Ānanda,
阿難。
which one of them
汝觀世間可作之法，
does not decay?
誰為不壞。
Yet
然
you have never heard
終不聞
that space can perish.
爛壞虛空。
Why?
何以故？
Because
[]
it is not a created thing.
空非可作，
[]
由是始終無壞滅故。

## The objective phenomena in the meditation

‘In your body,
則汝身中，
that which is
[]
solid
堅相
is the element of earth,
為地，
that which is
[]
liquid
潤濕
is the element of water,
為水，
that which is
[]
warm
煖觸
is {147} the element of fire
為火，
and that which
[]
moves
動搖
is the element of wind.
為風。
These four restraining elements
由此四纏，
divide your
分汝
pure, perfect, absolute and
湛圓妙
enlightened Bodhi
覺明心，
into
[]
seeing,
為視
hearing,
為聽
knowing
為覺
and
[]
discerning:
為察。
hence
[]
the five turbid conditions (kaṣāya)
@a@
from the beginning to the end.
從始入終，
@a@
五疊渾濁。

‘What is turbidity?
云何為濁。
Ānanda,
阿難。
take for instance
譬如
clear water
清水，
which is so by nature,
清潔本然。
and dust, earth, ashes and sand
即彼塵土灰沙之倫，
which are
[]
obstructive by nature.
本質留礙。
[]
二體法爾，性不相循。
If someone
有世間人，
throws earth and dust
取彼土塵，
into clear water,
投於淨水。
the former will lose
土失
their obstructive qualities
留礙，
and the latter
水亡
its clearness:
清潔。
the result is dirty water
容貌汩然，
which
[]
is called turbid.
名之為濁。
Your five turbid conditions
汝濁五重，
are like that dirty water.
亦復如是。

‘Ānanda,
阿難。
when you see space
汝見虛空
in the ten directions,
遍十方界。
your perception
空
and
[]
the void
見
are inseparable,
不分。
and since the void
有空
is bodiless
無體。
and
[]
your perception
有見
unenlightened,
無覺。
both unite
相織
into one falseness
妄成。
which
[]
is the first layer,
是第一重，
called
名為
“turbid kalpa.”
劫濁。

‘Your body
汝身
is made of four elements
現摶四大為體。
which
[]
limit your mind and divide it into
@a@
seeing,
見
hearing,
聞
feeling
覺
and
[]
knowing:
知，
@a@
壅令留礙。
the union of
[]
water,
水
fire,
火
wind
風
and
[]
earth
土，
with your
旋令
feeling
覺
and
[]
knowing
知。
begets another falseness
相織妄成。
which
[]
is the second layer,
是第二重，
called
名為
“turbid views.”
見濁。

@a@
性發
‘Your recollection
知
and
[]
habits
見。
give rise to intellection {148}
@a@
which responds to
容現
the six sense data.
六塵。
[]
又汝心中
This intellect has
憶識通習。
no independent form
@b@
apart from the objects of sense
離塵
@b@
無相。
and
[]
is devoid of nature
@c@
apart from perception:
離覺
@c@
無性。
it unites with sense data,
相織
to become another falseness
妄成。
which
[]
is the third layer,
是第三重，
called “turbid passions” (kleśa).
名煩惱濁。

‘In the endless rise and fall
@a@
of illusions in saṃsāra
又汝朝夕
@a@
生滅不停。
your intellect
知見
is intent on
每欲
staying in the world
留於世間，
whereas
[]
your karma
業運
forces you
每常
to transmigrate from place to place:
遷於國土。
they thus
[]
unite into another falseness
相織妄成，
which
[]
is the fourth layer,
是第四重，
called
名
“turbid being.”
眾生濁。

‘Fundamentally your
汝等
seeing
見
and
[]
hearing
聞
are by nature the same
元無異性。
but,
[]
being limited by sense data,
眾塵隔越，
they
[]
degenerate
無狀
into two separate
異生。
(faculties):
[]
they are
[]
aware of each other
@a@
within their (common) nature
性中
@a@
相知。
but
[]
differ
@b@
in their functions.
用中
@b@
相背。
As a result
[]
they are
同異
(as it were)
[]
upside down
失準。
and
[]
unite into another falseness
相織妄成。
which
[]
is the fifth layer,
是第五重，
called
名為
“turbid life.” {149}
命濁。

## The point of departure

‘Ānanda,
阿難。
if you wish to bring
汝今欲令
your
[]
seeing,
見
hearing,
聞
feeling
覺
and
[]
knowing
知，
into line with
遠契
the Tathāgata‘s
如來
absolute Eternity,
常
Bliss,
樂
Self
我
and
[]
Purity,
淨。
you should first
應當先
pick out
擇
the root of
@a@
birth and death,
死生
@a@
根本，
and
[]
turn its worldly falseness
依不生滅
back to
[]
its unworldly profound nature
圓湛性成，
until it is subdued
@b@
and
[]
reverts to Basic Bodhi,
以湛旋其虛妄滅生，
@b@
伏還元覺，
and then
[]
use this pure nature
@c@
as the causal mind-ground
得元明覺無生滅性
@c@
為因地心，
(i.e. as the point of departure)
(然後)
to perfect your
@d@
practice and realization of the fruit-ground.
圓成果地
@d@
修證。

‘This is
[]
like
如
purifying
澄
muddy water
濁水，
in a clean container;
貯於靜器，
left unshaken in complete calmness,
靜深不動，
the sand and mud
沙土
will sink to the bottom.
自沈，
When
[]
the clear water
清水
appears,
現前，
this is called
名為
the first suppression of
初伏
the intruding evil element of passion.
客塵煩惱。
When the mud has been removed
去泥
leaving behind
[]
only the clear water,
純水，
this is
[]
called
名為
the permanent cutting off of basic ignorance.
永斷根本無明。
Enlightenment is
明相
(pure and)
[]
unmixed;
精純，
and
[]
its manifestations are
一切變現，
not of the nature
不為
of kleśa,
煩惱，
but are
[]
in accord with
皆合
the immaculate virtues of
@a@
Nirvāṇa.
涅槃
@a@
清淨妙德。

## Looking into the roots of kleśa to find the sense organ suitable for meditation

‘What is
[]
the second decisive factor?
第二義者，
In your determination
汝等必欲
to develop the Bodhi Mind
發菩提心，
and
[]
to advance boldly
@a@
along the Bodhisattva Path
於菩薩乘
@a@
生大勇猛，
by relinquishing
決定棄捐
everything worldly,
諸有為相，
you should look closely into
應當審詳
the origin of kleśa,
煩惱根本。
[]
此無始來，
caused by
[]
your basic ignorance
發業
and
[]
developing discrimination,
潤生，
and
[]
see who {150} creates
誰作
and
[]
endures them.
誰受。

Ānanda,
阿難。
in your cultivation of
汝修
Bodhi,
菩提，
if you do not inquire into
若不審觀
the root of kleśa,
煩惱根本，
you will never know
則不能知
(how and)
[]
where
[]
the organs and sense data
虛妄根塵，
are turned upside down.
何處顛倒。
If you fail
處尚
to understand this,
不知，
how can you
云何
overcome them
降伏
to win
取
the Tathāgata stage
如來位。

‘Ānanda,
阿難。
if a man who is
汝觀世間
good at untying knots,
解結之人，
does not see them,
不見所結，
how can
云何
he undo them?
知解。
And
[]
you have never heard
不聞
that
[]
the void
虛空
can be unfastened
被汝隳裂。
for
何以故？
it has
空
neither form
無形
nor shape
相，
and
[]
is not like a knot
無結
that can be untied.
解故。
But your
則汝現前
eyes,
眼
ears,
耳
nose
鼻
and
[]
tongue
舌，
as well as
及與
your body
身
and
[]
mind,
心，
are the six
六為
decoys which a thief uses
賊媒，
to steal
自劫
the treasures of your house.
家寶。
For this reason,
由此
since the time without beginning,
無始
living beings
眾生
and
[]
this world,
世界，
have always been
[]
inter-locked
生纏縛故，
(in time and space)
[]
hence
[]
you are unable to leap beyond
@a@
the material world.
於器世間
@a@
不能超越。

‘Ānanda,
阿難。
what is (this)
云何名為
realm of
眾生
time
世
and
[]
space?
界。
Time means duration
世為遷流。
and
[]
space location.
界為方位。
You know that
汝今當知
the
東、西、南、北、
ten
東南、西南、東北、西北、
directions
上、下、
are in space
為界。
and that
[]
the past,
過去、
present
未來、
and

future
現在、
are in time.
為世。
There are
[]
ten directions (of space)
方位有十。
and
[]
three (aspects of) time.
流數有三。
All living beings
一切眾生
owe their bodies
[]
to illusory time and space
織妄相成。
which are
[]
interwoven within them
@a@
and continue to affect them.
身中貿遷，
@a@
世界相涉。
Although
[]
there are
而此界性
ten directions,
設雖十方，
[]
定位可明。
the worldly man
世間
recognizes only
祇目
the east,
東
west,
西
south
南
and
[]
north
北，
as cardinal points, but
[]
disregards the intermediate ones
@b@
and
[]
the zenith and nadir
上下
which he considers
[]
as unimportant. {151}
無位，
@b@
中無定方，
[]
四數必明。

‘The entanglement of
與世相涉，
the three
三
times with
[]
the four
四
cardinal points (3 x 4) or of
[]
the four
四
cardinal points with
[]
the three
三，
times (4 x 3)
[]
results in the constant
宛轉
twelve.
十二。
Allowing for
[]
the change and transformation of discriminative thoughts
流變
occurring thrice
三疊，
(to cover the past, present and future), this constant is increased from
[]
1
一
to

10,

百
and
[]
1,000
千。
to cover the whole field of activity of
總括始終。
each of
[]
the six sense organs,
六根之中，
its maximum sum of merits (i.e. its potential function) being
[]
represented by the
各各功德有
number 1,200.
千二百。

‘Ānanda,
阿難。
now measure the potentiality
@a@
(for merit) of each organ.
汝復於中，
@a@
克定優劣。
For instance,
如
your eyes can see things
眼觀見，(後暗前明。)
in front
前方全明。
and on both sides
[]
but nothing behind you.
後方全暗。
Its incomplete field of activity
左右旁觀
represents only
[]
two thirds
三分之二。
of the maximum,
[]
[]
統論所作，
[]
功德不全。
[]
三分言功。
[]
一分無德。
that is only
當知眼唯
800 merits.
八百功德。

‘As to
如
your ears,
耳周聽，
their field of activity
[]
includes all the ten directions:
十方無遺。
a sound is heard
動若
whether near
邇
or distant
遙。
while
[]
silence
靜
is registered as
[]
being boundless.
無邊際。
Hence
當知
this organ

1,200 merits.
一千二百功德。

‘The function of your nose
如鼻嗅聞，
relies on in and out breaths
通出入息。(有出有入，)

八百功德。

‘When your tongue

‘Ānanda,
阿難。
as you now wish to
汝今欲
go against
逆
the samsaric current of desire,
生死欲流，
you should
[]
revert to
返窮
the very organ
流根，
(from which it flows)
[]
until you reach
至
the state
[]
beyond birth and death.
不生滅。
(Therefore,)
[]
you should look into
當驗
the six functioning organs
此等六受用根，
and see which
[]
one is consistent
誰合
or not,
誰離，
is deep
誰深
or shallow
誰淺，
and
[]
is all-penetrating
誰為圓通，
or deficient.
誰不圓滿。
If you find
若能於此悟
the all-pervading organ,
圓通根，
you should turn back
逆彼
its karmic flow
(無始織妄)業流，
so that it accords with its penetrating quality: the difference between realization
[]
by means of this penetrating organ
得循圓通，
and that
[]
through a deficient one
與不圓根，
is comparable to that between
[]
a day and an aeon.
日劫相倍。
I have now revealed
我今備顯
to you
[]
the six organs
六湛圓明，
(arising from)
[]
your True Mind
本所功德，
and
[]
their respective potentialities
數量如是。
so that
[]
you can choose
隨汝詳擇
the one most suitable to you
其可入者。
and
[]
advance in your practice.
(吾當發明，)令汝增進。

‘All the Tathāgatas

一時
@a@
清淨。

The Buddha replied:
佛告阿難。
‘Although you have realized
汝今已得
the state of stream entry
須陀洹果。

wiped out

when

your mouth

Therefore,
是故應知
they are

neither one

‘Ānanda,

you should realize

your organs are

neither one

and that
[]
because
由
@a@

you have

seen everything upside down

@a@
(the illusion of)
[]
one and six have arisen
@b@

perfect and clean.

須陀洹，
has wiped out the
雖得
(illusory concept of) six,

you still retain
猶未
(that of) one.
亡一。

‘This is like
如
the void
太虛空

[]
called by different names
@a@
according to

the shapes of the containers:

if you

throw away the vessels

The Buddha said:

‘You have widened

The Buddha then
即時如來
ordered Rāhula

asked Ānanda:
問阿難言。
‘Do you hear it?’
汝今聞不。
Ānanda
阿難
and

the others in the assembly
大眾，
replied that
俱言
they did.
我聞。
When
[]
the bell was no more heard,
鐘歇無聲。
the Buddha

asked again:
又問言。
‘Do you still hear it?’
汝今聞不。
They all replied
阿難大眾，
that

they did not.
俱言不聞。
Rāhula again
時羅侯羅又

the Buddha asked:

‘Do you hear it?’
汝今聞不。
They replied
阿難大眾，
that

又言俱聞。
The Buddha then

asked Ānanda:
問阿難。
‘What do you mean
汝云何

云何
not hearing?’
不聞。
Ānanda and the others

the sound and its echo stop,

Ānanda and the others

A little later

the Buddha

asked again:

‘Is there any sound?’
爾今聲不。
They all replied
阿難大眾，
that there was none.
答言無聲。
Then Rāhula
有頃羅侯
rang the bell again
更來撞鐘。

the Buddha asked:

‘Is there any sound?’
爾今聲不。
They all replied

俱言有聲。
The Buddha

then asked Ānanda:
問阿難。
‘What do you mean by
汝云何

云何無聲。
Ānanda and the others
阿難大眾
replied
俱白佛言：
that if the bell was rung,

there was sound
則名有聲。
and when
[]
both the sound and its echo stopped,
擊久聲銷，音響雙絕，
this was called

The Buddha said:
佛語阿難及諸大眾。
‘Why did you

自語矯亂。
Ānanda and the others
大眾阿難，
asked:
俱時問佛。
‘Why do you say that

The Buddha said:

Ānanda,

when both the sound and

its echo {160} ceased,

you said

there was

no hearing:

the bell

how did you

non-existence

concern only the sound

‘Therefore,

其所結之元，
he will be unable to
我信是人終不
undo them.
能解。
[]
世尊。
In this assembly
[]
I and those who
我及會中
need to study and learn more,
有學聲聞，
are in the same case.
亦復如是。
Since the time without beginning
從無始際
we and
與
our delusions
諸無明，
have both been
[]
subject to birth and death,
俱滅俱生。
and
[]
although
雖
we have cultivated
得如是
good qualities that have enabled us to
[]
widen our knowledge by hearing
多聞善根，
(about it all) and so
[]
are called
名為
leavers of homes,
出家，
we are like a person
猶
suffering from malaria
隔日瘧。
which recurs every other day.
[]
Will you take pity on us
惟願大慈，
and save us from drowning?
哀愍淪溺。
Will you tell us which of
[]
our bodies and minds
今日身心，
are in a knot
云何是結，
and
[]
how to untie it
從何名解。
so that
亦令
all suffering beings
未來苦難眾生，
can escape
得免
from saṃsāra
輪迴，
and
[]
avoid falling
不落
(again) into
[]
the three realms
三有。
of existence?‘ {162}
[]

After saying this,
作是語已，
he and all the assembly
普及大眾
prostrated themselves,
五體投地。
shed bitter tears
雨淚翹誠，
and
[]
eagerly awaited
佇
the Buddha‘s
佛如來
supreme revelation.
無上開示。

The Buddha
爾時世尊
took pity on
憐愍
Ānanda
阿難，
and those in the assembly
及諸會中
who still needed to study and learn
諸有學者。
as well as
亦為
on future living beings.
未來一切眾生，
In order to
[]
enable them to
為
sow the cause
@a@
of their future appearance in the world
[]
@a@
出世因
and so
[]
become
作
the eye (of wisdom)
將來眼。
to guide coming generations.
[]
He extended His shining golden-hued hand
以閻浮檀紫金光手，
to touch Ānanda‘s head
摩阿難頂。
(and comfort him).
[]

Thereupon
即時
@a@
十方
all Buddha lands
普佛世界，
in the ten directions
@a@
shook six times
六種震動。
and
[]
Tathāgatas, countless as motes of dust
微塵如來住世界者，
sent out,
[]
from the tops of their heads,
@b@
radiant rays of light
各有寶光
@b@
從其頂出。
[]
其光同時於彼世界，
which reached Jetavana
來祇陀林，
to shine upon the Buddha‘s head.
灌如來頂。
This had not been seen before
@c@
by the assembly.
是諸大眾，
@c@
得未曾有。
Then Ānanda
於是阿難
and
及
all those present
諸大眾，
heard
俱聞
countless Buddhas
十方微塵如來，
declare with one voice:
異口同音，
[]
告阿難言：
‘Excellent, Ānanda,
善哉阿難。
if you want to know about
汝欲識知
the innate ignorance
俱生無明，
that
[]
causes you to
使汝
transmigrate in saṃsāra,
輪轉生死結根，
(you should know that) the roots of your birth and death
[]
are
唯
your six sense organs.
汝六根，
[]
更無他物。
If you want to know about
汝復欲知
Supreme Bodhi,
無上菩提，
it is
[]
these six organs
@d@
that
[]
will enable you
令汝
speedily
速
to realize
證
happiness
安樂
in liberation
解脫
and
[]
permanence in Nirvāṇa.’
寂靜妙常，
@d@
亦汝六根，
[]
更非他物。

Although Ānanda
阿難雖
had heard
聞
these Dharma voices,
如是法音，
he was still
[]
not clear
心猶未明。
about their (profound) meaning. So
[]
he bowed
稽首
and
[]
asked the Buddha:
白佛。
‘How can
云何
the same six organs
@a@
cause me
令我
to transmigrate in saṃsāra
生死輪迴，
and
[]
be happy
安樂
in absolute Nirvāṇa?‘ {163}
妙常，
@a@
同是六根，
[]
更非他物。

The Buddha said: ‘Ānanda,
佛告阿難。
both
[]
organs
根
and
[]
their objects
塵
spring from
[]
the same source,
同源。
bondage
縛
and
[]
liberation
脫
are not two
無二。
different things.
[]
Consciousness is illusory,
識性虛妄，
like a flower in the sky.
猶如空華。
Ānanda,
阿難。
your knowing
@a@
originates from each phenomenon
由塵
@a@
發知。
which
[]
takes on form
@b@
because of your sense organs.
因根
@b@
有相。
Both form and seeing
相見無性，
are mutually dependent,
同於交蘆。
like two bundles of rushes that stand by leaning against each other.
[]
Therefore,
是故
if your intellect
汝今知見
acts as
立
the knower,
知，
this is
即
the
[]
root of your ignorance
無明本。
(but) if
[]
it
知見
is free from
無
seeing,
見，
it will be
斯即
Nirvāṇa
涅槃
which is
[]
transcendental
無漏
and
[]
pure.
真淨。
How then can
云何
the latter
是中
allow
更容
foreign elements
他物。
to intrude?’
[]

@a@
爾時世尊，
To repeat His instruction,
欲重宣此義，
the Buddha
@a@
read the following gāthā:
而說偈言。

{gatha}
True Nature is free from all phenomena
真性有為空
Which are illusions by causes created.
緣生故如幻
Noumena neither rise nor fall, but all
無為無起滅
Phenomena are flowers in the sky.
不實如空華
The unreal reveals the real
言妄顯諸真
But both are but illusions.
妄真同二妄
Since there is nothing real nor unreal
猶非真非真
How can there be a subject and an object?
云何見所見
For between the two there is no true nature like {164}
中間無實性

The point where two rush bundles meet when set upright.
是故若交蘆
Tying and untying from the same cause arise,
結解同所因
While the saintly and the worldly are not dual.
聖凡無二路
Consider underlying nature at the point
汝觀交中性
Of meeting where both ‘is‘ and ‘is not‘ cannot be.
空有二俱非
If you disregard it you are in delusion,
迷晦即無明
If you awaken to it you are free at once.
發明便解脫
Six knots are untied one after the other;
解結因次第
When six are undone one vanishes as well.
六解一亦亡
Choose an organ that is all penetrating
根選擇圓通
To enter the holy stream and attain Bodhi.
入流成正覺
Old habits flow like torrents in
陀那微細識
Ālaya‘s subtle consciousness.
習氣成瀑流
Since the real yet unreal can create confusion
真非真恐迷
I have refrained from revealing it to you.
我常不開演
If mind be set on searching for the mind, that which
自心取自心
At heart is not illusion becomes illusory. {165}
非幻成幻法
If you stop all grasping then there is nothing real:
不取無非幻
If what is not illusion ceases
非幻尚不生
To arise, where can illusion be?
幻法云何立
This is the profound Lotus Dharma (Law),
是名妙蓮華
The precious Bodhi of the royal gem,
金剛王寶覺
The Samādhi of seeing all things as illusion
如幻三摩提
Which in a finger-snap leads to the state beyond
彈指超無學
All study. The unsurpassed Doctrine was followed
此阿毗達磨
By all Bhagavats in all directions
十方薄伽梵
On the One Path that to Nirvāṇa leads.
一路涅槃門
{/gatha}

# How to Untie the Six Knots

Thus
於是
Ānanda
阿難
and the assembly
及諸大眾，
listened to
聞
the compassionate Buddha‘s
佛如來
unsurpassed sermon
無上慈誨，
and gāthā, whose
祇夜伽陀，
profound meanings were
雜糅精瑩，
so enlightening and penetrating,
妙理清徹，
that
[]
their mental eyes
心目
were opened;
開明，
they praised
歎
what they had
[]
never seen before.
未曾有。
Ānanda
阿難
then
[]
brought his palms together,
合掌
prostrated and said:
頂禮白佛。
‘I have today
我今
listened to
聞
the Buddha‘s
佛
compassionate teaching
無遮大悲，
which revealed
[]
@a@
性
the pure, subtle and permanent
淨妙常
Reality
真實
of
法句
the (self-) nature,
@a@。
but
[]
I am still
心猶
not clear about
未達
how to
[]
untie the (six) knots one after the other
六解一亡，
and what you meant by
[]
“when the six knots are undone
舒結
the one {166} also vanishes.”
倫次。
Will you again take pity on
惟垂大慈，再愍
this assembly
斯會
and
及
future generations
與將來，
and teach us
施以法音，
in order to
[]
wash our defilements away?’
洗滌沈垢。

The Buddha who was on his lion-seat,
即時如來於師子座，
adjusted his inner garments
整涅槃僧，
and outer robe
歛僧伽梨，
and
[]
took
@a@
from the teapoy
攬七寶几。
[]
引手於几，
@a@
取
a piece of beautiful cloth
@b@
which the Yama deva had given Him.
劫波羅天所奉
@b@
華巾。
Then
[]
in the presence of
@b@
the assembly,
於大眾
@b@
前
He tied a knot
綰成一結。
and
[]
showed it to Ānanda,
示阿難
asking:
言：
‘What is this?’
此名何等。
Ānanda
阿難
and the others
大眾
[]
俱白佛
replied:
言：
‘It is a knot.’
此名為結。
The Buddha then
於是如來
[]
綰疊華巾，
tied another knot
又成一結。
and asked: ‘What is this?‘ They all replied: ‘This also is a knot.’
[]
The Buddha
於是如來
[]
綰疊華巾，
tied four more knots,
又成四結。
showing each to
[]
Ānanda and asking:
重問阿難。
‘What is this?‘
此名何等。
They all
阿難大眾，
replied that
又白佛言：
each was a knot.
此亦名結。
[]
如是倫次綰疊華巾，
[]
總成六結。
[]
一一結成，
[]
皆取手中所成之結，
[]
持問阿難，
[]
此名何等。
[]
阿難大眾，
[]
亦復如是次第詶佛，
[]
此名為結。

The Buddha said to Ānanda:
佛告阿難。
‘When I first tied this cloth,
我初綰巾，
you called it a knot.
汝名為結。
[]
此疊華巾，
There is
[]
only one piece of cloth
先實一條。
but
[]
why did you call
@a@
the second
第二
and
[]
third ties
第三，
@a@
云何汝曹
also knots?’
復名為結。
Ānanda replied:
阿難白佛言：
‘World Honoured One,
世尊。
although there is
(此寶疊華緝績)
only one piece of cloth,
成巾，雖本一體。
[]
如我思惟，
if you tie it once,
如來一綰，
there
[]
will be a knot
得一結名。
and if you
[]
tie it a hundred times,
若百綰成，
there will
[]
be a hundred knots.
終名百結。
But
何況
this cloth
此巾
has only six knots
祇有六結。
because
[]
you only tied it six times.
終不至七，亦不停五。
Why do you
云何如來
agree to my
祇許
calling the first
初時。
tie a knot and
[]
disagree to
@b@
the second
第二
and third
第三
ones also being
[]
@b@
不
called knots,’
名為結。

The Buddha said: ‘Ānanda,
佛告阿難。
[]
此寶華巾，汝知
originally
此巾元
there was
[]
only one piece
止一條。
of cloth, but
[]
when I tied it six times,
我六綰時，
there were six knots.
名有六結。
As you see it,
汝審觀察，
the length of
[]
cloth was
巾體
the same before
是同，
but
[]
is now different
@a@
with
因
its six
[動靜根覺空滅]
knots.
結
@a@
有異。
[]
於意云何。
The first knot I tied
初綰結成，
was {167} called
名為
the first one
第一。
and altogether
如是乃至
I tied six of them,
第六結生。
do you think that
(吾今欲)
the sixth one
將第六結，
can be
@a@
called the first knot?’
名成第一
@a@
不。
Ānanda replied:
[]
‘No, World Honoured One,
不也，世尊。
so long as
[]
there are six knots,
六結若存，
the last one is
斯
the sixth
第六名，
and
[]
cannot be called
終非
the first.
第一。
Even if
縱
@b@
我歷生
I discuss this
盡其明辯，
for the rest of my life,
@b@
how can
如何
I number
令
these six knots
是六結
in the wrong order?’
亂名。

The Buddha said:
佛言：
‘It is so; these six knots are different
如是，六結不同。
but
[]
come from one length of cloth
循顧本因，一巾所造。
and
[]
you cannot
令其雜亂，
reverse their order.
終不得成。
It is
[]
the same with
@a@
your six sense organs
則汝六根，
@a@
亦復如是。
which, though
[]
coming from the same
畢竟同中，
(source),
[]
are manifestly
生畢竟
different.
異。
Ānanda,
佛告阿難。
clearly you object to
汝必嫌
the six knots
此六結不成，
and
[]
prefer one (piece of cloth)
願樂一成，
but
[]
how can you
復云何
obtain it?’
得。
Ānanda replied:
阿難言：
‘If these six knots remain,
此結若存，
concepts of
[]
right and wrong
是非
will arise
鋒起。
in great confusion,
[]
with (such things as)
於中自生
this knot
此結
is not that one
非彼，
and
[]
that knot
彼結
is not this one.
非此。
World Honoured One,
如來
if
今日
all the knots
若總
were to be untied,
解除。
there would
[]
remain nothing,
結若不生，
with complete elimination of
則無
thisness and thatness:
彼此。
then
[]
in the absence of
尚不
even one,
名一，
how can
@b@
there be
六
@b@
云何
six?’
成。

The Buddha said:
佛言：
‘Likewise,
@a@
when
[]
the six knots are untied,
六解
the one also vanishes.
一亡，
@a@
亦復如是。
It is
[]
because of
由汝
@b@
無始
confusion in your mad mind
心性狂亂，
since the time without beginning
@b@
that
[]
your intellect
知見
gives rise to
@c@
illusions,
妄
@c@
發。
the unceasing creation
發妄不息，
of which
[]
disturbs your seeing
勞見發塵。
and causes it to perceive objects in the same way
[]
that
如
troubled eyes
勞目睛，
see dancing flowers.
則有狂華。
Hence
[]
in the clear and bright (Reality)
於湛精明，
arise
@d@
without any cause
無因
all worldly phenomena
亂
@d@
起。
such as
一切世間
mountains,
山
rivers,
河
the great earth,
大地
saṃsāra
生死
and
[]
nirvāṇa
涅槃，
which
[]
are but
皆即
dancing flowers
@d@
(created by)
[]
confusion, trouble
狂勞
(passions) and
[]
inversion.‘ {168}
顛倒
@d@
華相。

Ānanda asked:
阿難言：
‘How can one untie these knots
@a@
created by trouble and confusion
此勞同結，
@a@
云何解除。

Then
[]
the Buddha
如來
held (up)
以手將
the piece of cloth,
所結巾
pulled
偏掣
its left end
其左。
and asked:
問阿難言：
‘Can it be
如是
untied in this way?’
解不。
Ānanda replied: ‘No,
不也，
World Honoured One.’
世尊。
The Buddha then
旋復以手
pulled
偏牽
the right end
右邊。
and asked:
又問阿難，
‘Can it be
如是
untied in this way?’
解不。
Ānanda replied:
[]
‘No,
不也，
World Honoured One.’
世尊。
The Buddha said:
佛告阿難。
‘I have pulled
吾今以手
both ends of the cloth
左右各牽，
but have been unable to
竟不
untie the knots.
能解。
What will you do now?’
汝設方便，云何解成。
Ānanda replied:
阿難白佛言：
‘World Honoured One,
世尊。
(each) knot
[]
should be untied
當於
in its center
結心解
(heart).’
(即分散。)
The Buddha said:
佛告阿難。
‘Correct, Ānanda, correct.
如是如是。
A knot should be untied
若欲除結，
from its heart.
當於結心。
Ānanda,
阿難。
[]
我說
the Buddha Dharma
佛法
which I expound
[]
manifests
@a@
due to causes
從因緣
@a@
生。
and
[]
is beyond
非
those coarse forms
@b@
that come from worldly
取世間
(concepts of)
[]
mixtures
和
and
[]
unions.
合
@b@
麤相。
When
[]
the Buddha
如來
reveals
發明
the mundane
世
and
[]
supramundane,
出世法，
He knows
知
their chief causes
其本因
and
[]
concurrent conditions.
隨所緣出。
He is even clear about
如是乃至
the number of drops of rain
@c@
in a place as far away from here as there are
[]
sand grains in the Ganges,
恒沙界外
@c@
一滴之雨，亦知頭數。
as well as
[]
why
現前
pine trees arc straight
種種松直
and
[]
brambles crooked,
棘曲
geese white
鵠白
and
[]
crows black.
烏玄
[]
皆了元由。
Therefore,
是故
Ānanda,
阿難。
choose one organ
隨汝心中
from the six,
選擇六根。
and
[]
if its knot is untied,
根結若除，
all objects of sense
塵相
will vanish
自
of themselves.
滅。
When
[]
all illusions disappear,
諸妄銷亡，
if this is not Reality,
不真
what more do you expect?
何待。
Ānanda,
阿難。
tell me now
吾今問汝，
if the six knots of this cloth
此劫波羅巾六結現前，
can be untied simultaneously.’
同時解縈，得同除不。

Ānanda replied:
[]
‘No,
不也，
World Honoured One,
世尊。
because
[]
they were
是結
originally
本
tied
@a@
one after the other
以次第
@a@
綰生。
and
今日
should be
當須
untied in the same order.
次第而解。
Although
[]
they are
六結
in the
[]
same {169} piece of cloth,
同體，
they were not tied
結不
simultaneously;
同時。
how can
@b@
they now be untied
則結解時，
@b@
云何
all at once?’
同除。

The Buddha said:
佛言：
‘Your six organs(?)
六根
should be
[]
disengaged
解除，
in the same way.
亦復如是。
When you
此根
begin to
初
disentangle them,
解，
you will
[]
realize
先得
that
[]
the ego is void.
人空。
When this voidness
空性
is perfectly clear,
圓明，
you will
[]
realize
成
that
[]
all dharma (phenomena) are void.
法解脫。
When you are
[]
disengaged
解脫
from dharma,
法已，
the voidness
俱空
(of ego and dharma)
[]
will vanish.
不生。
This is called
是名
the Patient Endurance of the Uncreate
@a@
achieved by means of
[]
Samādhi in the Bodhisattva
菩薩從三摩地，
stage.’
[]
@a@
得無生忍。

After Ānanda
阿難
and the assembly
及諸大眾，
had heard the Buddha‘s teaching,
蒙佛開示，
their understanding
慧覺
was clear
圓通，
and
[]
free from
得無
doubt and suspicion.
疑惑。
Ānanda
[]
brought his palms together,
一時合掌，
prostrated himself
頂禮雙足，
and said:
而白佛言：
‘Today our
我等今日
bodies and minds
身心
are clear,
皎然，
at ease and unhindered.
快得無礙。
Though
雖復
I have understood what you mean by
悟知
the disappearance of
@a@
(both)
[]
one and six,

@a@
亡義。
I am
[]
still
然猶
unable to

perfect
圓通
my sense organs.
本根。
World Honoured One,
世尊。
I am like
我輩
a lonely wanderer
飄零，
and
[]
a hapless orphan.
積劫孤露。
How fortunate
何心何慮，
have I been to
[]
meet the Buddha
預佛
and to
[]
be His relative,
天倫。
like a hungry baby
如失乳兒，
who suddenly
忽
meets
遇
its suckling mother.
慈母。
This gives me
若復因此
a chance to
際會
attain the holy goal,
道成。
but although I have
[]
listened to
所得
His profound words,
密言，
I am still unawakened
還同本悟。
as if I had not heard them.
則與未聞無有差別。
Will you please
惟垂大悲，
reveal to me
惠我
the Ultimate Approach
秘嚴。
(by means of the appropriate organ)?‘ {170}
(成就如來最後開示。)

After saying this,
作是語已。
he prostrated himself
五體投地。
and concentrated on his inner potentiality
退藏密機，
to receive the profound instruction.
冀佛冥授。

Thereat
爾時

## Meditation on the six sense data

Kauṇḍinya, and four other bhikṣus,
憍陳那五比丘，
rose from his seat,
即從座起，
prostrated himself with his head
頂禮
at the feet of the Buddha
佛足，

及於雞園，
[]
觀見
@a@
如來最初成道。
I heard His voice,
於佛音聲，
understood
悟
His teaching and awakened to
明
the Four Noble Truths.
四諦。
When questioned by the Buddha,
佛問比丘，
I interpreted them correctly
我初稱解。
and
[]
the Tathāgata
如來
sealed
印
my awakening by
[]
naming me
我名
Ājñāta (Thorough Knowledge).
阿若多。
As His wonderful voice
妙音
was mysteriously all-embracing,
密圓。
@b@
我於音聲
I attained
得
arhatship
阿羅漢。
by means of sound.
@b@

sound is the best

Upaniṣad then
優波尼沙陀，
rose from his seat,
即從座起，
prostrated himself with his head
頂禮
at the feet of the Buddha
佛足，
and declared:
而白佛言：
‘I also met the Buddha
我亦觀佛
soon after His enlightenment.
最初成道。
After meditating on impurity
觀不淨相，
which
[]
I found repulsive
生大厭離。
and from which I {171} kept,
[]
I awakened to
悟
the underlying nature of all forms
諸色性。
I realized that (even our)
[]
@a@
以從不淨
bleached bones
白骨微塵，
that came from impurity
@a@
would be reduced to dust and would finally
[]
return to the void.
歸於虛空。
As both
[]
form and the void
空色
were perceived as
[]
non-existent,
二無，
I achieved
成
the state
[]
beyond study.
無學道。
The Tathāgata
如來
sealed
印
my understanding and
[]
named me
我名
Niṣad.
尼沙陀。
After
[]
eradicating the (relative) form,
塵色既盡，
wonderful form
妙色
(surūpa) appeared
[]
mysteriously all-embracing.
密圓。
Thus
[]
@b@
我從色相，
I attained
得
arhatship
阿羅漢。
through meditation on form.
@b@
As

the Buddha

form is the best

A Bodhisattva named ‘Fragrance-adorned’
香嚴童子，
then

rose from his seat,

prostrated himself with his head

I left Him

宴晦
While observing the rules of

清齋。
I saw

sandal incense.
沈水香，
In the stillness,
@a@
its fragrance

I inquired into this smell

neither smoke

neither whence to come
去無所著，

來無所從，
thereby
由是
my intellect vanished
意銷，

I achieved
the state

The Tathāgata

named me

the sudden elimination
@b@
of (relative) smell,

the wonderful fragrance

## Meditation on the five sense organs

Aniruddha then
阿那律陀，
rose from his seat,
即從座起，
prostrated himself with his head
頂禮
at the feet of the Buddha
佛足，
and declared:
而白佛言：

I was always

very fond of sleep
常樂睡眠。

the Tathāgata scolded me,
如來訶我
saying that

After

this severe reprimand,

the Pure Truth

as easy to see as

left home.
出家。
I tried

憶持
a line of His gāthā
如來一句伽陀。
but

failed for a hundred days

its first words,
得前
I forgot

the last ones,

remember the last words,

I forgot

the first ones.
遺前。
The Buddha
佛
took pity on my stupidity
愍我愚，
and
[]
taught me
教我
how to

live in a quiet retreat
安居
and
[]
to regularize my breathing.
調出入息。
At the time
[]
I looked exhaustively into
我時觀息，
each in and out breath
微細窮盡，
and realized that
[]
its rise, stay, change
生住異滅，
and
[]
end lasted only
諸行
an instant (kṣaṇa);
剎那。
thereby

my mind became clear
其心豁然。

unhindered
得大無礙。

out of the stream of transmigration
漏盡

attained
成
arhatship.
阿羅漢。
I came

All the Buddhas

urge them to

practise
修
Samantabhadra deeds
普賢行，
which
[]
are called after my name.
從我立名。
World Honoured One,
世尊。
I always use my mind to listen
我用心聞，
in order to
[]
distinguish the variety of
分別
views held by living beings.
眾生所有知見。
If in a place,
若於他方
separated from here
[]
by a number of worlds as countless as the sands in the Ganges,
恒沙界外，
a living being
有一眾生，
practises Samantabhadra deeds,
心中發明普賢行者，
I mount at once
我於爾時
a six-tusked elephant
乘六牙象，
and
[]
reproduce myself

in a hundred and a thousand apparitions
百千，
to come to his aid.
皆至其處。
Even if

@b@
彼障深，
he is unable {179} to see me

because of his great karmic obstruction,
@b@
I secretly lay my hand
我與其人暗中
on his head
摩頂，
to protect
擁護
and

comfort him
安慰，
so that
[]
he can succeed.
令其成就。
As
[]
the Buddha
佛
now asks about
問
the best means of perfection,
圓通，
according to my personal experience,
我說本因，
the best consists in
@d@
hearing with the mind,
心聞發明，
which leads to
[]
non-discriminative discernment.’
分別自在，
@d@
斯為第一。

Sundarananda then
孫陀羅難陀，
rose from his seat,
即從座起，
prostrated himself with his head
頂禮
at the feet of the Buddha
佛足，
and declared:
而白佛言：
‘When I left home
我初出家
to follow the Buddha,
從佛入道，
although fully ordained,
雖具戒律。
I failed to realize the state of Samādhi because
[]
my mind was always unsettled;
於三摩地，心常散動
I was, therefore,
[]
unable to reach
未獲
the condition
[]
beyond the stream of transmigration.
無漏。
The World Honoured One
世尊
then taught me
教我，
and Kauṣṭhila
及拘絺羅，
to fix the mind
觀
on the tip of the nose.
鼻端白。
I started this meditation
我初諦觀，
and
[]
some three weeks later,
經三七日。
I saw that the breath
見鼻中
that
[]
went in and out of my nostrils
氣出入
was like smoke;
如煙。
inwardly both body and mind were clear
身心內明，
and
[]
I looked through the (external) world
圓洞世界，
which
[]
became a pure emptiness
遍成虛淨，
like crystal everywhere.
猶如琉璃。
The smoke gradually disappeared
煙相漸銷，
and
[]
my breath became white.
鼻息成白。
As my mind opened,
心開
I achieved the state
[]
beyond the stream of transmigration.
漏盡，
Both my
[]
in and out breaths,
諸出入息
now bright,
化為光明，
illumined the ten directions

so that
[]
I attained

the arhat

stage.
[]
The World Honoured One
世尊
prophesied
記
that I would win enlightenment.
我當得菩提。
As
[]
He
佛
now asks about
問
the best means of perfection,
圓通，
according to my personal experience,
[]
the best is to eliminate breath
我以銷息，
which will then
[]
turn radiant,
息久發明，
ensuring the attainment of
[]
the stage of perfection
明圓
beyond the stream of transmigration.‘ {180}
滅漏，
@a@
斯為第一。

Pūrṇamaitrāyaṇīputra then
富樓那彌多羅尼子，
rose from his seat,
即從座起，
prostrated himself with his head
頂禮
at the feet of the Buddha
佛足，
and declared:
而白佛言：
‘In former aeons,
我曠劫來，
my power of speech
辯才
was unhindered

and

I preached

The World Honoured One

knew that

I had acquired

the great power of speech

and taught me how to

by preaching.
@c@
There, in his presence,
我於佛前
I assisted Him
助佛
in turning the Wheel of the Law

and since
[]
I could give the lion‘s roar,
因師子吼，
I attained

arhatship.
阿羅漢。
He sealed
世尊印
my unexcelled skill in
[]
expounding the Dharma.
我說法無上。
As
[]
He
佛
now asks about
問
the best means of perfection,
圓通，
according to my opinion,
[]
the best consists in
@d@
employing the Dharma voice
我以法音
to subdue the enmity of Māra
降伏魔怨，
and
[]
to stop the stream of transmigration.’
銷滅諸漏。
@d@
斯為第一。

Upāli
優波離，
then
[]
rose from his seat,
即從座起，
prostrated himself with his head
頂禮
at the feet of the Buddha
佛足，
and declared:
而白佛言：
‘I personally
我親
accompanied the Buddha
隨佛
and we
[]
climbed the city wall
踰城
to flee from home.
出家。
With my own eyes,
親觀如來
I saw how He
@a@
@b@
六年
endured hardship in His practice
勤苦
during the first six years of ascetic life,
@b@。
@a@
親見如來
subdued all demons,
降伏諸魔，
overcame heretics
制諸外道。
and
[]
freed Himself from
解脫
worldly

desires
貪欲
and
[]
all impure efflux
諸漏。
(āsrava) from the mind.
[]
He personally taught me discipline,
承佛教戒。
including the three thousand regulations

eighty thousand lines of conduct
八萬微細，
which purified
@c@
all my innate

conventional subtle karmas.

@c@
悉皆清淨。
As my

body and mind

[]
I attained

because of my strict

observance of discipline and control of body.
眾中綱紀。
@a@

I am now a pillar of discipline in this assembly
持戒修身，
and am regarded as the foremost disciple.
眾推為上。
As
[]
the Buddha

now asks about

圓通，
in my opinion,
[]
the best consists in
@d@
disciplining the body
我以執身，
so that it can

free itself from all restraints
身得自在，
and then
[]
in disciplining the mind

so that it can

both body and mind.’
然後身心

Mahā-Maudgalyāyana
大目犍連，
then
[]
rose from his seat,
即從座起，
prostrated himself with his head
頂禮
at the feet of the Buddha
佛足，
and declared:
而白佛言：
‘One day as
[]
I was begging for food in the street,
我初於路乞食。
I met

the three Kāśyapa brothers,

Uruvilvā,

三迦葉波，
who

preached
宣說
@b@
如來
the profound doctrine of causality
因緣深義。
taught by the Tathāgata.
@b@
Suddenly my mind opened
我頓發心，
and
[]
became all-pervading.
得大通達。
Then
[]
the Tathāgata
如來
gave me
惠我
a monk‘s robe
袈裟
and when
[]
I wore it,
著身，
my hair and beard fell out.
鬚髮自落。
I rambled
我遊
in the ten directions
十方，
and
[]
met no obstruction.
得無罣礙。
I thus acquired transcendental power
神通發明，
which

proved the foremost
推為無上。
and led to my

attainment of
成
arhatship.

Not only
寧唯
the World Honoured One,
世尊。
but
[]
@b@
十方
all the Tathāgatas
如來
in the ten directions
@b@
praised
歎
my supernatural powers
我神力，
which were
[]
perfect, pure, sovereign
圓明清淨，
and fearless.
自在無畏。
As
[]
the Buddha
佛
now asks about
問
the best means of perfection,
圓通，
in my opinion
[]
the best consists of
@c@
returning to stillness
我以旋湛，
to allow the light of the mind to appear
心光發宣，
just as muddy water by settling
如澄濁流，
becomes pure and clean as crystal.‘ {182}
久成清瑩，
@c@
斯為第一。

## Meditation on the seven elements

Usschuṣma then
烏芻瑟摩，
came forward
[]
in front of the Tathāgata,
於如來前，
joined the palms of his two hands,
合掌
prostrated himself with his head
頂禮
at the feet of the Buddha
佛之雙足，
and declared:
而白佛言：
‘I can still remember
我常先憶
that
[]
in a very remote aeon,
久遠劫前，
I was
[]
filled with sensual desire.
性多貪欲。
At the time
[]
a Buddha
有佛
called “The King of Immateriality”
@a@
appeared in the world.
出世，
@a@
名曰空王。
According to him,
說
those with lustful desires
多婬人，
increased their own hell fires.
成猛火聚。
He then
[]
taught me
教我
to meditate
遍觀
on the bones in my body,
百骸
on my four limbs
四肢
and
[]
on my warm and cold breaths.
諸冷煖氣。
So
[]
by turning inwardly
@b@
the spiritual light for pointed concentration,
神光
@b@
內凝，
my lustful mind turned into
化多婬心
the fire of wisdom.
成智慧火。
Since then,
從是
I was called “Fire Head”
@c@
by all the Buddhas.
諸佛皆呼召我，
@c@
名為火頭。
Because of my powerful
我以
Fire Light Samādhi,
火光三昧力故，
I attained
成
arhatship.
阿羅漢。
Then
[]
I took my great vow
心發大願，
to become a demigod (vira) so that when
[]
all Buddhas were
諸佛
about to attain enlightenment,
成道，
I would personally help them
我為力士，
to overcome
親伏
the enmity of Māra.
魔怨。
As
[]
the Buddha
佛
now asks about
問
the best means of perfection,
圓通，
according to my opinion,
[]
the best consists in
@d@
looking into
我以諦觀
@b@
身心
the non-existent heat
煖觸，
in my body and mind
@b@
in order to
[]
remove all hindrances thereto
無礙流通，
and
[]
to put an end to the stream of transmigration
諸漏既銷，
so that
[]
the great Precious fight can appear
生大寶燄，
and lead to
[]
the realization of
登
Supreme Bodhi.’
無上覺，
@d@
斯為第一。

Dharaṇiṃdhara Bodhisattva
持地菩薩，
then
[]
rose from his seat,
即從座起，
prostrated himself with his head
頂禮
at the feet of the Buddha
佛足，
and declared:
而白佛言：
‘I still remember that formerly
我念往昔，
when
[]
the Buddha of Universal Light
普光如來
appeared in the World,
出現於世。
I was a {183} bhikṣu
我為比丘，
who used to

@a@
@b@
一切要路津口，
@b@
田地險隘，
@c@
有不如法，
@c@
妨損車馬，
@a@
我皆平填。
build bridges
或作橋梁。
and
[]
carry sand and earth
或負沙土。
to improve
[]
the main roads, ferries,
@b@
rice-fields and dangerous passes
@b@
which were
[]
in bad condition or
@c@
impassable to horses and carts.
@c@
Thus
[]
I continued to toil
如是勤苦，
for a long time in which
[]
an uncountable number of
經無量
Buddhas appeared in the World.
佛出現於世。
If someone made
或有眾生
a purchase at the marketplace
於闤闠處，
and
[]
required another to carry it
要人擎物，
home for him,
我先為擎，
I did it
至其所詣，
[]
放物即行，
without charge.
不取其直。
When
[]
Viśvabhu Buddha
毗舍浮佛
appeared in the world
現在世時，
and
[]
famine was frequent,
世多饑荒。
I became a carrier
我為負人，
charging only one coin
@d@
no matter
[]
whether the distance
無問遠近，
was long or short.
[]
@d@
唯取一錢。
If an ox cart
或有車牛，
could not move in a bog,
被於泥溺，
I used my supernatural power
我有神力，
to push
為其推輪，
its wheels free.
拔其苦惱。
One day
時
the king
國大王
invited that Buddha to a feast:
延佛設齋。
as the road was bad,
[]
I levelled it for him.
我於爾時平地待佛。
The Tathāgata Viśvabhū
毗舍如來，
placed his hand on my head
摩頂
and said:
謂我，
“You should
當
level
平
your mind-ground,
心地，
then
[]
all things in the world
則世界地
will be on the same level.”
一切皆平。
(Upon hearing this),
[]
my mind opened
我即心開，
and
[]
I perceived
見
that
[]
the molecules of my body
身微塵，
did not differ from
@e@
those of which the world is made.
與造世界所有微塵
@e@
等無差別。
These molecules were such that
微塵自性，
they did not touch one another
不相觸摩。
and
[]
could not be touched
@f@
even by sharp weapons.
乃至刀兵
@f@
亦無所觸。
I then
[]
awakened to
我於法性，悟
the patient endurance of the uncreate
無生忍，
and thereby
[]
attained
成
arhatship.
阿羅漢。
Then
[]
by turning my mind inwards,
迴心
I realized
今入
the Bodhisattva stage
菩薩位中。
and when
[]
I heard
聞
the Tathāgatas
諸如來
expound
宣
@g@
妙蓮華
the Buddha‘s Universal Knowledge
佛知見地，
in the profound Lotus Sutra,
@g@
I was the first listener
我先證明
to be awakened to it and was
[]
made a leader of the assembly.
而為上首。
As
[]
the Buddha
佛
now asks about
問
the best means of {184} perfection,
圓通，
in my opinion,
[]
the best consists in
@d@
looking into
我以諦觀
the sameness of
@b@
body and universe
身界二塵，
@b@
等無差別，
@c@
本如來藏，
which are
[]
created by infection from falsehood
虛妄發塵，
arising from the Tathāgata store,
@c@
until this
[]
defilement vanishes
塵銷
and is replaced by
[]
perfect wisdom
智圓，
which then leads to
[]
the realization of
成
Supreme Bodhi.’
無上道，
@d@
斯為第一。

Candraprabha Bodhisattva
月光童子，
then
[]
rose from his seat,
即從座起，
prostrated himself with his head
頂禮
at the feet of the Buddha
佛足，
and declared:
而白佛言：
‘I still remember
我憶
that
[]
in the remotest of aeons
往昔
countless as the sands in the Ganges,
恒河沙劫，
there was
[]
a Buddha,
有佛
called Varuna,
@a@
who appeared in the world
出世，
@a@
名為水天。
and
[]
taught Bodhisattvas
教諸菩薩
to contemplate the element of water
修習水觀，
in order to
[]
enter into
入
the state of
[]
Samādhi.
三摩地。

‘This method consists in
[]
looking into the body
觀於身中，
wherein
[]
all watery elements
水性
do not
無
by nature
[]
suppress one another,
奪。
using as subjects of meditation
[]
first
初從
tears and snot,
涕唾，
and then
如是窮盡
saliva,
津
secretion,
液精
blood,
血，
urine and excrement,
大小便利，
and then
[]
reversing the order,
身中旋復，
[]
水性一同。
thereby
[]
perceiving
見
that
[]
this element of water
水
in the body
身中
does not differ from
@b@
that of
[]
the fragrant oceans
@c@
that surround
[]
@d@
與世界外
the Pure Lands of Buddhas,
浮幢王剎，
situated beyond our world.
@d@
@c@
諸香水海，
@b@
等無差別。

‘When I
我於是時，
achieved this contemplation,
@a@
I succeeded in realizing only the sameness of the element of water (everywhere)
[]
@a@
初成此觀。
but
[]
failed to relinquish
(但見其水)
(my view of) the body.
未得無身。
I was then a bhikṣu
當為比丘，
practising dhyāna
室中安禪。
and
[]
when my disciple
我有弟子，
peeped into the room,
闚窗觀室，
he saw
唯見
that
[]
@b@
清水
it was
[]
filled entirely with
遍在室中，
clear water,
@b@
without anything else.
了無所見。
As he was
[]
an ignorant boy,
童稚無知，
he
[]
picked up a broken tile,
取一瓦礫
threw it into the water
投於水內，
with a splash,
激水作聲，
gazed curiously
顧盼
and left.
而去。
When I came
[]
out of my {185} dhyāna
我出定後，
state,
[]
I suddenly felt
頓覺
pain in my heart
心痛。
as if I had the same trouble
[]
which
如
Śāriputra had
舍利弗
with a wicked demon.
遭違害鬼。
I thought,
我自思惟，
“Since
今
I have realized
我已得
arhatship,
阿羅漢道，
I should be free from
久離
all causal ailments.
病緣。
Why today,
云何今日
all of a sudden,
忽
have I pain in my heart;
生心痛，
is it not
[]
a sign of my backsliding?”
將無退失。
When the boy returned
爾時童子捷來我前，
and
[]
related
說
what he had seen and done
如上事。
during my meditation,
[]
I said:
我則告言：
“When next you
汝更
see water
見水，
in my room,
[]
open the door,
可即開門，
enter the water
入此水中，
and
[]
take away
除去
the broken tile.”
瓦礫。
The boy obeyed,
童子奉教。
for when I again
[]
entered the dhyāna
後入定時，
state,
[]
he saw the same broken tile
@c@
in the water;
還復見水，
@c@
瓦礫宛然，
he then
[]
opened the door
開門
and
[]
removed the tile.
除出。
When I
[]
came out of dhyāna,
我後出定，
my pain had vanished.
身質如初。
Later,
[]
I met countless Buddhas
逢無量佛，
before I encountered
如是至於
Sāgara-varadhara-buddhi-vikrīḍita-bhijña Buddha
山海自在通王如來，
(under whose instruction)
[]
I succeeded in
方得
relinquishing
亡
(the conception of)
[]
body,
身。
thereby realizing perfect union of this body
[]
and
與
the fragrant oceans
@c@
in the ten directions
十方界
@c@
諸香水海，
with absolute voidness,
性合真空，
without any further differentiation.
無二無別。
This is why
[]
I was called
今於如來得
“a son of a Buddha”
童真名，
and was
[]
qualified to attend
預
all Bodhisattva meetings.
菩薩會。

‘As
[]
the Buddha
佛
now asks about

圓通，
in my opinion
[]
the best consists in
@a@
achieving

the unhindered universalizing pervasion

@b@
thereby

realizing

圓滿菩提，
@a@
斯為第一。

The Bodhisattva of Crystal Light
琉璃光法王子，
then
[]
rose from his seat,
即從座起，
prostrated himself with his head
頂禮
at the feet of the Buddha
佛足，
and declared:
而白佛言：
‘I still remember
我憶
that
[]
once, in the remotest of aeons
往昔經
countless as the sands in the Ganges,
恒沙劫，
there {186} was
[]
a Buddha
有佛
called “Infinite Voice”
@a@
who
[]
appeared in the world
出世，
@a@
名無量聲。
to reveal to
開示
Bodhisattvas
菩薩
the profoundly enlightened fundamental awareness
本覺妙明。
which,
[]
by looking into
觀
this world
此世界
and
及
the bodily forms of all living beings,
眾生身，
could perceive that
[]
all were
皆是
created by the power of the wind
@c@
arising from
[]
illusory concurrent causes.
妄緣
@c@
風力所轉。
At the time, I
我於爾時，
inquired into
觀
the (illusory)
[]
setting up of the world,
界安立，
changing time,
觀世動時，
bodily motion
觀身動
and
[]
motionlessness,
止，
stirring of mind,
觀心動念，
in other words all kinds of movement which
[]
were fundamentally the same
諸動無二，
and
[]
did not differ from one another.
等無差別。
I then realized
我時覺了
that
[]
these movements
此群動性，
had neither whence to come
來無所從，
nor whither to go
去無所至。
and that
[]
all living beings
@c@
in the ten directions,

@c@
顛倒眾生，
as uncountable as the dust,

Likewise,

all living beings

in every small world of the great chiliocosm
三千大千一世界內，
@e@
所有眾生，
were like mosquitoes in a trap
如一器中，貯百蚊蚋，

於分寸中鼓發狂鬧。
Soon after
@f@
meeting that Buddha,
逢佛

I realized

the patient endurance of the uncreate.

As my mind opened,
爾時心開，
I perceived

東方
the land of

My body and mind
身心
gave out rays of light
發光，
that
[]
illumined all the worlds
洞徹
without obstruction.
無礙。

‘As
[]
the Buddha
佛
now asks about
問
the best means of perfection,
圓通，
in my opinion
[]
the best consists in
@a@
looking into
我以觀察
the power of the element of wind
風力
which has
[]
nothing (real) on which to rely,
無依，
thereby
[]
awakening to
悟
the Bodhi mind
菩提心，
so as
[]
to enter
入
Samādhi
三摩地，
and (then)
[]
to unite with
合
the profound One Mind

expounded by the Buddhas

@c@
@b@
一妙心，
@a@
斯為第一。

Ākāśagarbha Bodhisattva
虛空藏菩薩，
then
[]
rose from his seat,
即從座起。
prostrated himself with his head
頂禮
at the feet of the Buddha
佛足，
and declared:
而白佛言：
‘When the Tathāgata and I
我與如來，
were with
[]
Dīpaṃkara Buddha
定光佛所，
and
[]
realized
得
our boundless bodies,
無邊身。
I held in my hands
爾時手執
four big precious gems
四大寶珠，
which
[]
illumined
照明
all Buddha lands
@a@
in the ten directions,
十方
as uncountable as dust,
微塵
@a@
佛剎，
and
[]
transmuted them into
化成
the (absolute)
[]
void.
虛空。
Then
[]
my own mind
又於自心
appeared like
現
a great mirror
大圓鏡。
emitting
內放
ten kinds of
十種
mysterious precious light
微妙寶光，
which
[]
penetrated
流灌
the ten directions,
十方
reaching
盡
the boundaries of space
虛空際，
and causing
[]
all pure lands of Buddhas
諸幢王剎，
to enter the mirror
來入鏡內，
and then
[]
to intermingle freely
涉入
with my own body
我身。
which was just like
[]
unobstructive space.
身同虛空，
[]
不相妨礙。
(Then)
[]
my body
身
could enter perfectly
能善入
as many (samsaric)
[]
countries
@b@
as there are grains of dust
微塵
@b@
國土，
to carry out far and wide
廣行
the Buddha works
佛事，
(of salvation)
[]
so that
[]
universality could prevail
得大隨順。
(everywhere).
[]
This great
此大
transcendental power
神力，
derived from my
由我
close inquiry into
諦觀
the four elements
四大
which
[]
had nothing real to rely upon
無依，
and
[]
into false thinking
妄想
that rose and fell
生滅，
(alternately and ended in nothingness). I realized
[]
the non-duality of space
虛空無二，
and
[]
the sameness of the Buddha‘s
佛國本同。
(pure lands) and samsaric worlds,
[]
thereby achieving
於同發明，
the patient endurance of the uncreate.
得無生忍。

‘As
[]
the Buddha
佛
now asks about

according to my own experience,

boundless space,

entry {188} into

Samādhi

Maitreya Bodhisattva
彌勒菩薩，
then
[]
rose from his seat,
即從座起，
prostrated himself with his head
頂禮
at the feet of the Buddha
佛足，
and declared:
而白佛言：
‘I still remember
我憶
that
[]
in the remotest of aeons
往昔經
as uncountable as the dust,
微塵劫，
there was
[]
a Buddha
有佛
called Candra-sūrya-pradīpa
@a@
who appeared in the world
出世，
@a@
名日月燈明。
(to convert others).
[]
I followed him
我從彼佛
to leave home.
而得出家。
However,
[]
I (still) cherished worldly fame
and
[]
心重世名，
liked to mix with noble clans.
好遊族姓。
Then
爾時
the Tathāgata
世尊，
taught me
教我
how to
[]
practise dhyāna meditation
修習唯心
on the mind‘s consciousness
識定，
in order to
[]
realize
入
the state of
[]
Samādhi.
三摩地。
Ever since the following aeons,
歷劫已來，
I have
[]
used this Samādhi to serve
以此三昧事
Buddhas as many as the sands in the Ganges,
恒沙佛。
thereby
[]
eliminating completely my
@b@
(previous)
[]
mind set on worldly fame.
求世名心
@b@
歇滅無有。
When Dīpaṃkara Buddha
至然燈佛
appeared in the world,
出現於世。
(under his instruction)
[]
I realized
我乃得成
the consciousness-perfecting supreme
無上妙圓
Samādhi of the mind
識心三昧。
which enabled me to perceive that
[]
all Tathāgata (stores) and samsaric worlds,
乃至盡空如來國土
purity and impurity
淨穢
and
[]
existence and non-existence
有無。
were but
[]
appearances caused by
皆是我
my own mind‘s transformations.
心變化所現。
World Honoured One,
世尊。
because of my clear understanding that
我了如是
only the mind‘s consciousness was the cause
唯心識故，
(of all externals, I perceived)
[]
an unlimited number of Tathāgatas
@c@
coming out of the nature of consciousness,
識性流出
@c@
無量如來。
hence (the Buddha‘s) prophecy
今得授記，
that I shall be His successor.
次補佛處。

‘As
[]
the Buddha
佛
now asks about
問
the best means of perfection, {189}
圓通，
my opinion is that
我以
the best consists of
@a@
close examination into
諦觀
all appearances
十方唯
which are created by
[]
consciousness only,
識，
in order to
[]
perfect the conscious mind,
識心圓明，
thereby
[]
realizing complete reality
入圓成實，
and ensuring non-reliance on externals
[]
and
及
the breaking of
遠離
all attachments
依他
caused by discrimination,
遍計執，
thereby
[]
achieving
得
the patient endurance of the uncreate.’
無生忍，
@a@
斯為第一。

Mahāsthāma, a son of the Dharma king,
大勢至法王子，
who
[]
was the head of a group
與其同倫
of fifty-two Bodhisattvas,
五十二菩薩，
rose from his seat,
即從座起，
prostrated himself with his head
頂禮
at the feet of the Buddha
佛足，
and declared:
而白佛言：
‘I still remember
我憶
that
[]
in the remotest of aeons
往昔
countless as the sands in the Ganges,
恒河沙劫，
there was
[]
a Buddha called Amitābha
有佛出世，名無量光。
who was
[]
succeeded by eleven other Tathāgatas
十二如來，
in that kalpa.
相繼一劫。
The last one was called the
其最後佛名
“Buddha Whose
[]
Light Surpassed that of the Sun and Moonṃ;
超日月光。
he taught me
彼佛教我
how to realize the state of
[]
Samādhi by thinking exclusively of (Amitābha) Buddha.
念佛三昧。
By way of illustration,
譬如
if a man
有人，
concentrates his mind
一專為憶，
on someone else while
[]
the latter
一人
always forgets him,
專忘，
both may
如是二人，
meet and see,
若逢不逢，
but
[]
without recognizing,
或見非見。
each other.
[]
However,
[]
if both are keen on
二人
thinking of each other,
相憶，
their keenness
二憶
will grow
念深，
[]
如是乃至
from one incarnation to another
從生至生，
until they become
[]
inseparable like a body and its shadow.
同於形影，
[]
不相乖異。
The Tathāgatas in the ten directions
十方如來
have compassion for
憐念
all living beings
眾生，
and always think of them,
[]
like a mother
如母
who never ceases
[]
thinking of her son.
憶子。
If the son
若子
runs away,
逃逝，
her thoughts of him
雖憶
will not help.
何為。
But
[]
if he also thinks of her
子若憶母
with the same keenness,
如母憶時，
they will not be separated
@a@
in spite of
[]
the passing of transmigration.
母子歷生
@a@
不相違遠。
If a living being
若眾生
remembers
心憶佛
and
[]
thinks of the Buddha,
念佛，
he is {190} bound to
現前當來
behold Him
必定見佛。
in his present or future incarnation.
[]
He will not be far
@b@
from the Buddha
去佛
@b@
不遠，
and thus
[]
without the aid of
不假
any other expedient,
方便
his mind will be opened.
自得心開。
He is like
[]
a man whose body, perfumed by incense,
如染香人，
gives out fragrance;
身有香氣。
hence
[]
his name
此則名曰
“One Glorified by (Buddha‘s) Fragrance and Light.”
香光莊嚴。
From my fundamental cause-ground
我本因地
and with
[]
all my thoughts concentrated on the Buddha,
以念佛心，
I achieved
入
the patient endurance of the uncreate.
無生忍。
(This is why)
[]
I help all living beings of this world
今於此界，攝
to control their thoughts by
[]
repeating the Buddha‘s name
念佛人
so that they can
[]
reach the Pure Land.
歸於淨土。
As
[]
the Buddha
佛
now asks about
問
the best means of perfection,
圓通，
I hold that
@a@
nothing can surpass
我無選擇，
the perfect control of the six senses
都攝六根
with continuous pure thoughts
淨念相繼，
in order to
[]
realize
得
Samādhi.’
三摩地，

## Meditation on the organ of hearing

Thereupon
爾時
Avalokiteśvara Bodhisattva
觀世音菩薩，
rose from his seat,
即從座起，
prostrated himself with his head
頂禮
at the feet of the Buddha
佛足，
and declared:
而白佛言：
[]
世尊。
‘I still remember
憶念我
that
[]
long before numbers of aeons
昔
countless as the sand grains in the Ganges,
無數恒河沙劫，於時
a Buddha
有佛

@a@
appeared in the world.

@a@
名觀世音。
When I was
我於
with Him,
彼佛
I developed
發
the Bodhi Mind
菩提心。
and,
[]
for my entry into Samādhi,
@b@
I was
[]
instructed by Him to
彼佛教我
practise meditation
@c@
by means of
[]
the organ of hearing.
從聞思
@c@
修，
@b@
入三摩地。

{gatha}
‘At first by directing the organ of hearing into the stream of meditation,
初於聞中，
this organ was detached from its object,
入流亡所。
and by wiping out (the concept of) both sound and stream-entry,
所入既寂。
both disturbance and stillness
動靜二相
became clearly {191} non-existent.
了然不生。
Thus advancing step by step
如是漸增。
both hearing and its object ceased completely,
聞所聞盡。
but I did not stop where they ended.
盡聞不住。
When the awareness of this state and this state itself were realized as non-existent,
覺所覺空。
both subject and object merged into the void, the awareness of which became all-embracing.
空覺極圓。
With further elimination of the void and its object
空所空滅。
both creation and annihilation vanished giving way
生滅既滅。
to the state of Nirvāṇa which then manifested.
寂滅現前。
{/gatha}

‘Suddenly
忽然
I leaped over
超越
both
[]
the mundane
世
and

supramundane,
出世間。
thereby realizing

an all-embracing
@a@
brightness
@b@
pervading

the ten directions,
十方

圓

acquired

two unsurpassed

the same merciful power

rose from his seat,
即從座起，
prostrated himself with his head
頂禮

佛足，
and
[]
reverently
承佛威神
chanted
說
the following gāthā:
偈對佛。

{gatha}
Perfect and clear by nature is the Bodhi ocean,
覺海性澄圓
Pure and faultless Bodhi is in essence wonderful.
圓澄覺元妙
Its fundamental brightness shone, so by chance creating
元明照生所
An object which then obscured its radiant nature.
所立照性亡
Thus in delusion there appeared one-sided emptiness
迷妄有虛空
In which an imaginary world arbitrarily was built.
依空立世界
Steadying itself, the thinking process made the continents
想澄成國土
While the (illusory) knower became a living being.
知覺乃眾生
The voidness so created within Bodhi
空生大覺中
Is but a bubble in the ocean. Worldly
如海一漚發
Realms, countless as the dust, arose
有漏微塵國
In this (relative) emptiness.
皆依空所生
When the bubble bursts, the void‘s unreality
漚滅空本無
Is exposed: how much more so is that of the three realms?
況復諸三有
Though all return to One Nature at the source,
歸元性無二
There are many expedient methods for the purpose.
方便有多門
Though holy nature pervades all, direct
聖性無不通
Or inverse methods are expedients;
順逆皆方便
Hence newly initiated minds of different
初心入三味
Aptitudes are quick or slow to enter Samādhi.
遲速不同倫
Form which from thought crystallizes
色想結成塵
Is, too difficult to look through. {203}
精了不能徹
How can perfection be achieved
如何不明徹
Through this impenetrable form?
於是獲圓通

Sound, voice, word and speech are each
音聲雜語言
Confined to specific definition
但伊名句味
Which by itself is not all embracing.
一非含一切
How can they help perfection to achieve?
云何獲圓通
Smell, perceived when in contact with the nose,
香以合中知
Without that contact is non-existent.
離則元無有
How can that which is not always present
不恒其所覺
Be a means to achieve perfection?
云何獲圓通
Taste exists not of itself, but is
味性非本然
Perceived when flavour‘s present.
要以味時有
Since sense of taste is ever varied
其覺不恒一
How can it to perfection lead?
云何獲圓通
Touch exists when there‘s an object touched;
觸以所觸明
Without an object touch is naught.
無所不明觸
Since contact and its absence are not constant,
合離性非定
How can touch help to achieve perfection?
云何獲圓通
Dharma is inner defilement called;
法稱為內塵
Reliance thereon implies an object.
憑塵必有所
Since subject and object are not all embracing,
能所非遍涉
How can dharma lead one to perfection?
云何獲圓通
The organ of sight, although perceiving clearly,
見性雖洞然
Sees things in front but cannot see behind.
明前不明後
How can partial (sight of) the four quarters
四維虧一半
Help one to achieve perfection?
云何獲圓通
The inward and the outward breath
鼻息出入通
Have no link uniting them. {204}
現前無交氣
How can they, thus unconnected,
支離匪涉入
Be used to achieve perfection?
云何獲圓通
The tongue is useless touching nothing;
舌非入無端
When flavour is present, there is taste
因味生覺了
Which vanishes when flavour‘s absent.
味亡了無有
How can this help to achieve perfection
云何獲圓通
Body must be conditioned to the object touched;
身與所觸同
Both cannot be used for all embracing meditation
各非圓覺觀
Which is beyond both subject and object with their limits.
涯量不冥會
How can this serve to achieve perfection?
云何獲圓通
The tumult of thinking with the mind disturbs
知根雜亂思
The serenity of right perception.
湛了終無見
Since stirring thoughts are most hard to eradicate
想念不可脫
How can intellect serve to achieve perfection?
云何獲圓通
Union of consciousness with eye and sight
識見雜三和
Has three components that are not settled.
詰本稱非相
How can that which is devoid of substance
自體先無定
Be used as a means to win perfection?
云何獲圓通
The hearing mind which reaches into space
心聞洞十方
Needs a great cause for its development;
生於大因力
But untrained men cannot realize it.
初心不能入
How can this help to achieve perfection?
云何獲圓通
Meditation on the nose is only an expedient
鼻想本權機
Means to control the mind by fixing it for the moment,
祇令攝心住
But wrong dwelling can create an illusory abode.
住成心所住
How can this be used to achieve perfection?
云何獲圓通
Preaching the Dharma plays upon voice and words,
說法弄音文
But awakening occurred during practice long ago, {205}
開悟先成者
Words and speeches never going beyond the worldly stream.
名句非無漏
How can this be a means to achieve perfection
云何獲圓通
Observance of rules of discipline controls
持犯但束身
The body but never that which is beyond it.
非身無所束
Since control of body is not all embracing
元非遍一切
How can this serve to achieve perfection?
云何獲圓通
Transcendental powers come from a former cause;
神通本宿因
How can they derive from discriminating consciousness?
何關法分別
Since thinking from externals cannot stray,
念緣非離物
How can it serve to achieve perfection?
云何獲圓通

If the element of earth be used for contemplation,
若以地性觀
It is solid and cannot be penetrated;
堅礙非通達
Belonging to the worldly it lacks spirituality.
有為非聖性
How can it be used to achieve perfection?
云何獲圓通
If meditation be on the element of water,
若以水性觀
The thoughts that then arise have no reality.
想念非真實
Beyond feeling and seeing is the absolute;
如如非覺觀
How then can water help to achieve perfection?
云何獲圓通
If for meditation the element of fire be used,
若以火性觀
Dislike of desire is not complete renunciation;
厭有非真離
‘Tis no expedient for newly initiated minds.
非初心方便
How then can fire become a means to achieve perfection?
云何獲圓通
If meditation is on the element of wind,
若以風性觀
Motion and stillness are a false duality
動寂非無對
From which Supreme Bodhi cannot develop.
對非無上覺
How can wind serve to achieve perfection?
云何獲圓通
If the element of space be used for meditation,
若以空性觀
Its dimness and dullness cannot be enlightenment. {206}
昏鈍先非覺
Since whate‘er is unenlightened differs much from Bodhi,
無覺異菩提
How can the element of space help to achieve perfection?
云何獲圓通
If on the element of consciousness you meditate,
若以識性觀
It changes and is not permanent.
觀識非常住
The mind fixed on it being false
存心乃虛妄
How can that element then help you to achieve perfection?
云何獲圓通
Phenomena are all impermanent;
諸行是無常
Thinking originally comes and goes.
念性元生滅
Since cause will ever differ from effect,
因果今殊感
How can the element of perception achieve perfection?
云何獲圓通

I now submit to the World Honoured One
我今白世尊
That all Buddhas in this world appear
佛出娑婆界
To teach the most appropriate method
此方真教體
Which consists in using pervasive sound.
清淨在音聞
The state of Samādhi can be
欲取三摩提
Realized by means of hearing.
實以聞中入
Thus was Avalokiteśvara freed from suffering.
離苦得解脫
Hail to the Regarder of sound
良哉觀世音
Who, during aeons countless as Ganges‘ sand,
於恒沙劫中
Entered as many Buddha lands to win
入微塵佛國
The power and comfort of his independence158
得大自在力
And bestow fearlessness upon all living beings.
無畏施眾生
O you who (have achieved) the sound profound,
妙音觀世音
The seer of sound, of sound the purifier, {207}
梵音海潮音
Who, unfailing as the sound of ocean tides, saves all beings in the world make
救世悉安寧
Them secure, ensure their liberation and attainment of eternity.
出世獲常住
Reverently I declare to the Tathāgata
我今啟如來
What Avalokiteśvara said:
如觀音所說
When one dwells in quietude,
譬如人靜居
Rolls of drums from ten directions
十方俱擊鼓
Simultaneously are heard,
十處一時聞
So hearing is complete and perfect.
此則圓真實
The eyes cannot pierce a screen,
目非觀障外
But neither can mouth nor nose,
口鼻亦復然
Body only feels when it is touched.
身以合方知
Mind‘s thoughts are confused and unconnected,
心念紛無緒
(But) voice whether near or far
隔垣聽音響
At all times can be heard.
遐邇俱可聞
The five other organs are not perfect,
五根所不齊
But hearing really is pervasive.
是則通真實
The presence or absence of sound and voice
音聲性動靜
Is registered by ear as ‘is‘ or ‘is not‘.
聞中為有無
Absence of sound means nothing heard,
無聲號無聞
Not hearing devoid of nature.
非實聞無性
Absence of sound is not the end of hearing,
聲無既無滅
And sound when present is not its beginning.
聲有亦非生
The faculty of hearing, beyond creation
生滅二圓離
And annihilation, truly is permanent.
是則常真實
Even when isolated thoughts in a dream arise, {208}
縱令在夢想
Though the thinking process stops, hearing does not end,
不為不思無
For the faculty of hearing is beyond
覺觀出思惟
All thought, beyond both mind and body.
身心不能及
In this Sahā world
今此娑婆國
Teaching is by voice.
聲論得宣明

Living beings who cognize not hearing‘s nature,
眾生迷本聞
Follow sound to continue transmigrating.
循聲故流轉
Though Ānanda memorized all that he had
阿難縱強記
Heard, he could not avoid perverted thoughts.
不免落邪思
This is to fall into saṃsāra by clinging to sound;
豈非隨所淪
Whilst reality is won against the worldly stream.
旋流獲無妄
Listen, Ānanda, listen closely,
阿難汝諦聽
In the name of Buddha I proclaim
我承佛威力
The Vajra King of Enlightenment,
宣說金剛王
The inconceivable understanding that illusions
如幻不思議
Are unreal, the true Samādhi that begets all Buddhas.
佛母真三昧
You may hear of esoteric methods
汝聞微塵佛
From Buddhas countless as the dust,
一切秘密門
But if you cannot eradicate
欲漏不先除
Desire, to hear much causes errors.
畜聞成過誤
To hear your very Self, why not turn backward
將聞持佛佛
That faculty employed to hear Buddha‘s words
何不自聞聞
Hearing is not of itself,
聞非自然生
But owes its name to sound.
因聲有名字
Freed from sound by turning hearing backwards,
旋聞與聲脫

What do you call that which is disengaged
能脫欲誰名
When one sense organ has to its source returned,
一根既返源
All the six senses thereby are liberated. {209}
六根成解脫
Seeing and hearing are like optical illusions,
見聞如幻翳
Just as all three worlds resemble flowers in the sky.
三界若空華
With hearing disengaged, the illusory organ vanishes;
聞復翳根除
With objects eradicated, perfectly pure is Bodhi
塵銷覺圓淨
In utter purity, the bright light pervades all,
淨極光通達
With its shining stillness enfolding the great void.
寂照含虛空
All worldly things, when closely looked at,
卻來觀世間
Are but illusions seen in dreams.
猶如夢中事
Dream-like was the Mātaṅgī maiden:
摩登伽在夢
How could she keep your body with her?
誰能留汝形
Like a clever showman
如世巧幻師
Presenting a puppet play,
幻作諸男女
Though movements are many,
雖見諸根動
There is but one controller.
要以一機抽
When that control is stopped,
息機歸寂然
Figures show no nature.
諸幻成無性
Likewise are the six organs,
六根亦如是
Derived from one ālaya
元依一精明
Which divides into six unions.
分成六和合
If one of these returns to source,
一處成休復
All six functions are ended.
六用皆不成
With all infection ended,
塵垢應念銷
Bodhi is then realized.
成圓明淨妙
Any defiling remnant requires further study
餘塵尚諸學
Whereas full enlightenment is the Tathāgata.
明極即如來
Ānanda and all you who listen here
大眾及阿難
Should inward turn your faculty
旋汝倒聞機
Of hearing to hear your own nature {210}
反聞聞自性
Which alone achieves Supreme Bodhi.
性成無上道

That is how enlightenment is won.
圓通實如是
Buddhas as many as the Ganges‘ sand
此是微塵佛
Entered this one gateway to Nirvāṇa.
一路涅槃門
All past Tathāgatas
斯門已成就
Have achieved this method.
過去諸如來
All Bodhisattvas now
現在諸菩薩
Enter this perfection.
今各入圓明
All who practise in the future
未來修學人
On this Dharma should rely.
當依如是法
Avalokiteśvara did not practise
我亦從中證
It alone, because through it I also passed.
非唯觀世音
The Enlightened and World Honoured One
誠如佛世尊
Has asked about the best expedients
詢我諸方便
For those in the Dharma ending age
以救諸末劫
Who wish from saṃsāra to escape
求出世間人
In their search for Nirvāṇa‘s heart.
成就涅槃心
It is best to contemplate on worldly sound:
觀世音為最
All other methods are expedients
自餘諸方便
Used by Buddha in particular cases
皆是佛威神
To keep disciples from occasional trouble.
即事捨塵勞
They are not good for indiscriminate practice
非是長修學
By men of different types.
淺深同說法
I salute the Tathāgata Store
頂禮如來藏
Which is beyond the worldly stream.
無漏不思議
Blessed be coming generations
願加被未來
So that they have (abiding) faith
於此門無惑
In this easy expedient. {211}
方便易成就
‘Tis good for teaching Ānanda
堪以教阿難
And those of the Dharma ending age
及末劫沈淪
Who should use the hearing organ
但以此根修
Which surpasses all others
圓通超餘者
And with the True Mind accords.
真實心如是
{/gatha}
