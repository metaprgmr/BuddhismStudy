Ānanda
阿難
rose from his seat,
即從座起，
prostrated himself with his head
頂禮
at the feet of the Buddha
佛足
and said:

sought only

praised Ānanda and said:

Ānanda and the assembly

brought their palms together

concentrated their minds

默然受教。

# The Tathāgata Store from which Arise Both Saṃsāra & Nirvāṇa

The Buddha said:
佛言：
‘Ānanda,
阿難
you should know that
當知。
the absolute nature is completely enlightened;
妙性圓明，
it is
[]
beyond name and form
離諸名相，
and is
[]
fundamentally
本來
free from
無有
either
[]
the world
世界
or
[]
living beings.
眾生。
Because of
因
ignorance,
妄
there arises
[]
birth
有生。
which is
[]
followed by death.
因生有滅。
So
[]
birth and death
生滅
are unreal
名妄。
and
[]
the wiping out of
滅
the unreal
妄
brings about
名
the real
真。
which is
[]
called
是稱
Supreme Bodhi
如來無上菩提，
and
及
Pari-nirvāṇa.
大涅槃，
Hence these terms
[]
imply
@a@
the twofold transmutation
二轉
@a@
依號。
(of kleśa and saṃsāra into Bodhi and Nirvāṇa).
[]
Ānanda,
阿難。
if you now wish to
汝今欲
achieve
修真
the state of
[]
Samādhi
三摩地，
in order
[]
directly
直
to reach
詣
the Tathāgata‘s
如來
Pari-nirvāṇa,
大涅槃
[]
者，
@b@
先
you should know
當識
first
@b@
the two inverted causes
@c@
which lead to the existence of
[]
living beings
此眾生
and
[]
the world.
世界
@c@
二顛倒因。
The non-rising
@d@
of these
[]
inversions
顛倒
@d@
不生，
is the Tathāgata‘s
斯則如來
true
真
state of
[]
Samādhi.
三摩地。

# The Origin of Living Beings & the World

‘Ānanda,
阿難。
what are
云何名為
these
[]
two inversions?
眾生顛倒。
[]
阿難。
@a@
由
@b@
性
Because of
[]
the mind‘s (arbitrary) awareness
明心，
of
@a@
the (underlying)
[]
bright nature,
@b@
the latter which is
[]
fundamentally enlightened
性明圓(故。因明)
becomes
發
an objective (form)
性，
as opposed to a false (perception). Thus from
[]
fundamental nothingness
性妄
arises
見
actual phenomenon.
生。
(Therefore),
從
the existence
[]
(of ignorance)
畢竟無
and
成
its creation
究竟有。
(of the world and living beings),
[]
@c@
此有
@d@
所有，
the causeless cause
非因
of subjective (ignorance) and
[]
its objective creation, {223}
所因，@c@
and
[]
subjective
@d@
(living beings)
[]
dwelling
住
in their
[]
objective abode
所住相，
(the world)
[]
have no real basis.
了無根本。
From
[]
(Reality)

which
此
does not
無
abide

anywhere
[]
spring
建立
the world

and living beings.
及諸眾生。

## The Inverted Cause of the Existence of Living Beings

‘(What is the inverted cause of the seeming existence of living beings?)
[]
The
[]
faulty awareness
迷
of
[]
[]
本
completely enlightened nature
圓明，
creates
是生
a falsehood
虛妄。
which has neither nature nor basis.  If you wish to restore the real,
[]
this very wish
妄性無體，
(pertains to the samsaric mind and) is
[]
not related to
非有
absolute nature.
所依。
[]
將欲復真，
If the
[]
unreal mind
欲真
is used to recover
[]
[]
已非
real
真
nature,
真如性。
the latter
非真求復，
will be
宛成
unreal
非相。
and of necessity there follow
[]
illusory birth and existence
非生非住，
as well as
[]
unreal mind and dharma
非心非法，
which will
[]
unfold endlessly
展轉發生。
and will
[]
gain in intensity
生力發明，
thereby
[]
creating (new) karma
熏以成業。
and so
[]
responses from those
@b@
sharing the
[]
same karma.
同業
@b@
相感。
@c@
因有
This
[]
karmic responsiveness
感業
leads to
@c@
the
[]
interdependence of births and deaths.
相滅相生。
Hence
由是故有

眾生
the inverted cause
顛倒。
of the seeming existence of
[]
living beings.
@d@

## The Inverted Cause of the Existence of the World

‘Ānanda,

what is

@a@
世界
the inverted cause
顛倒。
of the
[]
world
@a@
(i.e. the realm of space and time)?
[]
Because of the
[]
illusory existence
是有
(of ignorance) and
[]
its creation
所有，
(of the world and living beings) there arises
[]
the mortal lot
分段妄生，
clinging to space.
因此界立。
Because of the
[]
causeless cause
非因
of subjective (ignorance) and its
[]
objective creation
所因，
and because of
[]
subjective (living beings)
無住
dwelling
所住，
in their objective abode, all
[]
unfolding continuously
@b@
and {224}
[]
transitorily,
遷流
@b@

time arises.
因此世成。
Thus

the three aspects of time

the four cardinal points of space
