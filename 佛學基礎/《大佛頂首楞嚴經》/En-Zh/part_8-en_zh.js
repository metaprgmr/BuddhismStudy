# States of Māra Caused by the Five Aggregates

As the gathering drew
[]
to a close,
即時
the Buddha
如來
@a@
將罷法座。
@b@
於師子床，
grasped the teapoy
攬七寶几，
and made a move to rise
@a@
from His lion seat,
@b@
when
[]
suddenly he changed his mind,
(迴紫金山，)
leant back
再來仉倚。
and
[]
said to Ānanda
普告大眾
and the assembly:
及阿難言：
‘You śrāvakas
汝等有學緣覺
and
[]
pratyeka-buddhas
聲聞，
need to study more
[]
in your quest of
今日迴心趣
Supreme Bodhi:
大菩提無上妙覺。
I have taught you
吾今已說
the
[]
method of correct cultivation
真修行法。
but you
[]
still do not know
汝猶未識
the
[]
subtle states of Māra
@c@
which appear when
[]
you practise
修
śamatha-vipaśyanā.
奢摩他毗婆舍那
@c@
微細魔事。
When they manifest,
魔境現前，
if you
[]
fail to distinguish them
汝不能識。
and
[]
if your minds are not in a right state,
洗心非正，
you will
[]
fall into the evil ways
落於邪見。
of either the demons
或汝陰魔。
or your five aggregates,
[]
of the heavenly Māras,
或復天魔。
of ghosts and spirits,
或著鬼神。
or of mischievous sprites.
或遭魑魅。
If you are
[]
not clear about them,
心中不明，
you will
[]
mistake thieves for your own sons.
認賊為子。
Further,
又復
you may
[]
regard some little progress
於中得少
as complete achievement,
為足。
like
如
the
[]
untutored Bhikṣu
第四禪無聞比丘，
who when he reached the fourth dhyāna heaven
[]
presumed
妄言
that he had
[]
become a saint;
證聖。
after he had enjoyed his reward
天報已畢，
in heaven,
[]
all indications
衰相
of his approaching fall
[]
appeared.
現前。
As he vilified the arhats,
謗阿羅漢
he created the karma of {277}
[]
future incarnation
身遭後有，
and then
[]
fell into
墮
the
[]
avīci hell.
阿鼻獄。
You
[]
should listen carefully
汝應諦聽。
to what
[]
I now tell you in detail.’
吾今為汝仔細分別。

Ānanda
阿難
rose from his seat and,
起立，
with all those requiring further study,
并其會中同有學者，
prostrated himself at the Buddha‘s feet
歡喜頂禮，
and
[]
awaited His compassionate instruction.
伏聽慈誨。

The
[]
Buddha said:
佛告
[]
阿難及諸大眾。
‘You
[]
should all know
汝等當知。
that the
[]
clear substance of the profound
@a@
and bright basic Bodhi of
@a@
@b@
有漏
all living beings of
世界
the
[]
twelve types of
十二類生，
birth in saṃsāra
@b@
@a@
本覺妙明覺圓心體，
is that of all Buddhas in the ten directions.
與十方佛 (無二無別。)
It is
[]
because you think wrongly
由汝妄想
that you are
[]
not clear about the noumenon
迷理為咎，
and so
[]
become stupid and full of desires
癡愛發生。
which
[]
lead to your complete delusion.
生發遍迷，
Hence the
[]
(relative) voidness,
故有空性。
and as
[]
you are always deluded,
化迷不息，
the
[]
world is falsely created.
有世界生。
All countries countless as dust are in saṃsāra
則此十方微塵國土， (非無漏者，)
because of
皆是
your obstinate wrong thinking.
迷頑妄想安立。
But you
[]
should know
當知
that (relative)
[]
voidness
虛空
is created
生汝
in your minds,
心內，
like a small cloud
猶如片雲
that is but
[]
a speck in the great emptiness;
點太清裏。
how much more
[]
so
況
is the world
諸世界
which is
[]
within this (relative) voidness?
在虛空耶。
If you
汝等
realize the real
一人發真
to return to the source,
歸元，
the
[]
void in the ten directions
此十方空
will vanish.
皆悉銷殞。
Why, then,
云何
will not all the countries in that voidness
空中所有國土
shake and crack?
而不振裂。

‘When you practise dhyāna
汝輩修禪
to preserve
飾
the state of
[]
samādhi,
三摩地。
all Bodhisattvas,
十方菩薩，
and
及
all great arhats
諸無漏大阿羅漢，
whose essence of mind
心精
is already penetrative,
通吻，
are unmoved,
當處湛然。
but the
[]
kings of the demons,
一切魔王
ghosts,
及與鬼
spirits
神
and
[]
lower heavens
諸凡夫天，
are shocked
[]
to see
見
their
其
palaces
宮殿
break open without cause
無故崩裂。
and the
[]
great earth
大地
shake and crack;
振坼
all those on earth and in the air
水陸飛騰，
take fright
無不驚慴。
whereas
[]
worldly men
凡夫
who are
[]
deluded
昏暗，
do not feel anything,
不覺遷訛。
because
[]
these demons,
彼等
though they have acquired {278}
咸得
five supernatural powers,
五種神通，
still fail to realize
唯除
transcendental insight
漏盡，
into the ending of the stream of transmigration, for they have
[]
not broken their links
戀此
with saṃsāra;
塵勞。
how can
如何
they let
令汝
you destroy
摧裂
their dwellings?
其處。
This is why
是故
they
鬼神，及諸天魔，魍魎妖精，
come to
@a@
trouble and annoy you
@a@
when you
[]
enter
於
the state of
[]
samādhi.
三昧時，
@a@
僉來惱汝。

‘However,
然彼諸魔
in spite of
雖
their rage,
有大怒。
these demons are there in
彼塵勞內。
your profound state of bodhi
汝妙覺中。
and are like people trying in vain
[]
to blow out sunlight
如風吹光，
and to
[]
cut water with a sword,
如刀斷水，
[]
了不相觸。
while
[]
you are like
汝如
boiling water
沸湯，
that melts solid ice.
彼如堅冰，煖氣漸鄰，不日銷殞。
Though they
[]
rely on
徒恃
their

super natural powers,
神力，
they are but
但為其
externals
客。
and will only
[]
succeed in
成就
destroying you
破亂，
if you,
[]
who own the five aggregates
@a@
in your minds,
由汝心中
@a@
五陰主人。
are deluded
主人若迷，
and let them do so.
客得其便。
For
[]
these demons cannot harm you
@b@
in your state of dhyāna
當處禪那，
if you are awakened and are not deluded.
覺悟無惑，
@b@
則彼魔事無奈汝何。
If you
[]
wipe out the (five) aggregates,
陰銷
you will
[]
enter
入
the state of
[]
brightness
明，
wherein all demons
則彼群邪
are but dark vapours.
咸受幽氣。
Since light destroys darkness,
明能破暗，
they will perish
@c@
as soon as
[]
they approach you;
近自
@c@
銷殞。
how then dare they
如何取留，
disturb the state of samādhi?
擾亂禪定。

‘On the other hand,
[]
if you fail to awaken
若不明悟，
and are thereby
[]
deluded by the five aggregates,
被陰所迷。
then,
則汝
Ānanda,
阿難
you will become a son of Māra
必為魔子，
and help the demons.
成就魔人。
As an illustration,
如
Mātaṅgī

one of the

rules

@a@
祗毀一戒。
of pure living, but since
[]
your mind was pure,
心清淨故，
you were not ruined.
尚未淪溺。
This shows
此乃
the (imminent)

loss of
隳
all

precious bodhi.
寶覺
@b@

You were almost

as if

It is

If the nightmare

one‘s mind

can

以為其本。

reaches this stage,

will discern
發明，
(the sorry plight of living beings) and on being

pressed harder,
內抑過分。
it will

give rise to
忽於其處
infinite sadness.
發無窮悲。
He will even
如是乃至
regard
觀見
gadflies and mosquitoes
蚊蟲，
as his
猶如

赤子，
on whom

he takes pity,
心生憐愍，
bursting

if he regards it as sainthood,

he will

him to be miserable

can leap over

regards it
若作

the

demon of wildness
狂魔

boast

## The Ten States Affected by the Third Aggregate of Conception (Sañjña)

‘Ānanda,
阿難。
[]
彼善男子
in the
[]
cultivation of
修
samādhi,
三摩提
when the
[]
second aggregate of receptiveness
受陰
ceases to hinder
盡
the
[]
practiser,
者，
although he is
[]
still
雖未
in the worldly stream,
漏盡，
his mind
心
can now
[]
escape from
離
his body,
其形，
like
如
a bird
鳥
from its cage.
出籠，
From his worldly state he
[]
can now achieve
已能成就，
the
(從是凡身上歷)
sixty succeeding
菩薩六十
holy stages
聖位。
of Bodhisattva development into Buddhahood and thereby
[]
take
得
@a@
意
any form
生身，
at will,
@a@
free to move
隨往
anywhere
[]
without hindrance.
無礙。
This is like
譬如
a man
[]
who
有人，
talks in his sleep
熟寐寱言。
and though
[]
he does not
是人雖則
know what he says,
無別所知。
his words
其言
are in order
已成音韻倫次。
(and comprehensible), and those
[]
who are not asleep
令不寐者，
understand him.
咸悟其語。
This is
此則名為
the
[]
third aggregate of conception
想陰區宇。
which conditions his meditation.
[]

‘If
若
all his stirring thoughts
動念
stop,
盡，
he will be
[]
rid of the thinking process
浮想銷除。
and his
[]
clear mind
於覺明心，
will be (like a mirror) {291}
[]
rubbed clean of
如去
the
[]
covering dust,
塵垢。
and will
[]
throw light upon his
@a@
(present) incarnation from birth to death.
一倫生死，
@a@
首尾圓照，
Then
名
the
[]
third aggregate of conception
想陰
ceases to function
盡。
and the
[]
practiser
是人
will be able to
則能
leap above and beyond
超
the
[]
kalpa of turbid passions,
煩惱濁。
the
[]
main cause
觀其所由，
of which is the seeming
[]
pervasiveness
融通
of his
[]
wrong thinking.
妄想
[]
以為其本。

1.
[]
‘Ānanda,
阿難。
now that
[]
the
[]
practiser
彼善男子
is
[]
free from anxiety,
@a@
after his receptiveness has vanished,
受陰虛妙，
@a@
不遭邪慮，
he finds himself in the state of
[]
perfect dhyāna
圓定發明。
and
[]
[]
三摩地中，
likes its pure brightness.
心愛圓明，
But he may be tempted to
[]
concentrate on
銳其精思，
the one
[]
thought of skilfully advancing,
貪求善巧。
thus
爾時
submitting to
@b@
the
[]
heavenly demon
天魔
@b@
候得其便，
who immediately
[]
possesses another man
飛精附人，
(to harm the meditator).
[]
@c@
口說經法。
This man,
其人
unaware
不覺
that he is
[]
possessed,
是其魔著，
will, as directed,
[]
preach the Dharma
@c@
of the sūtras, and
[]
think that
自言謂
he too has
[]
realized
得
Supreme Nirvāṇa.
無上涅槃。
He will then
[]
come to
來彼
[]
求巧
the
[]
practiser‘s place
善男子處，
and
[]
take the high seat
敷座
to teach him the Dharma.
說法。
To show his skill,
其形斯須，
he will appear
@d@
either as a monk,
或作比丘，
@d@
令彼人見。
[]
或為
Indra,
帝釋。
[]
或為
a woman
婦女。
or
或
a nun,
比丘尼。
and
[]
@e@
或寢暗室，
his body
身
will
有
send out
[]
rays of light
光明
that
[]
illumine the dark bedroom.
@e@。
The practiser
是人
will
[]
mistake
愚迷，
him for a Bodhisattva
惑為菩薩。
and will
[]
believe what he says;
信其教化，
as a result,
[]
his mind will waver
搖蕩其心。
and he will
[]
break the rules
破佛律儀，
and
[]
have desires.
潛行貪欲。
The man
[]
will speak of
口中好言
weal and woe,
災祥變異。
[]
或言
of a Buddha
如來
appearing at a certain place,
某處出世。
[]
或言
of scorching fire
@f@
in the kalpa of destruction
劫
@f@
火。
and
[]
[]
或說
of future
[]
fighting and wars
刀兵。
to frighten
恐怖於人。
and
[]
ruin other people.
令其家資，無故耗散。
This is
此名
the
[]
Strange Ghost
怪鬼，
who has
[]
become a {292} demon
@g@
in his old age
年老
@g@
成魔，
and who now comes to
[]
trouble the practiser.
惱亂是人。
When he is
[]
weary of his misdeeds,
厭足心生，
he will
[]
leave the possessed man.
去彼人體。
Then both
[]
@h@
弟子
@i@
與
teacher
師，
(the possessed man)
[]
and
@i@
pupil
@g@
(the practiser)
[]
will suffer all the
[]
miseries inflicted by the royal law.
俱陷王難。
You should
汝當
first be clear
先覺，
about this temptation
[]
to avoid
不入
returning to
[]
saṃsāra,
輪迴。
but if you are
[]
deluded
迷惑
and do
[]
not recognize it,
不知，
you will
[]
fall into
墮
the

unintermittent hell.
無間獄。

2.

三摩地中，
But he may be

tempted to roam about
心愛遊蕩，
(in unknown regions) and so

concentrates on

一眾聽人，

各各如是，

The practiser will be deceived into
是人愚迷，

The practiser

# The Falsehood of the Five Aggregates

instruction,

rose from his seat

remember well,
憶持無失。
[]
於大眾中重復

白佛。
‘As the Buddha

has said,
所言
the
[]
@b@
五陰相中，
five kinds of falsehood

arising from the
為本想心。
five aggregates

are due to the

The Buddha said:
佛告
‘Ānanda,
阿難。
pure Reality
精真
is

profound Enlightenment,
妙明

basic Enlightenment

spring from

that Yajñadatta
如演若多，
deceived himself into

believing in the image
迷頭認影。
of his head.
[]
Fundamentally falsehood
妄元
has
[]
no cause
無因。
but
[]
false thinking
於妄想中
sets it up
立因緣性。
and
[]
deluded people
迷因緣者，
(further) mistake it for

being the self as such.
稱為自然。
Even voidness
彼虛空性，
is

but an illusion,
猶實幻生。
(how much more so are)

cause

self as such
自然，
which are
皆是
@c@

product of discrimination

living beings.
@c@
Ānanda,

if you know

where falsehood arises,

there is no falsehood,
若妄元無，
how can you
@d@
speak of cause?
說妄因緣
@d@
元無所有。
Still less
何況
can you
[]
speak of the self as such.
不知，推自然者。
Therefore,

Tathāgata

reveals to you
與汝發明，
that the
[]
basic cause of
@e@
the
[]
five aggregates
五陰

同是妄想。

### Falseness of the first aggregate of form (rūpa)

@a@
first to your parents‘
[]
thought of giving birth
父母想

如我先言

心想登高，
you feel
[]
distress in the soles

But there is
[]
neither vinegar nor cliff
懸崖不有。醋物未來。
and if your
[]
body is not of the same
汝體必非
(illusory)
[]
nature as falsehood,
虛妄通倫。
how can water come
口水如何
to your mouth when you
[]
think of vinegar?
因談醋出。
Therefore,
是故
you should
[]
know that
當知，
your {326}
汝現

名為
the
[]
first
@b@
state of

congealation
堅固

第一
of your
[]
false thinking.
妄想。

### Falseness of the second aggregate of receptiveness (vedanā)

‘We have spoken
即此所說
of the thought of
[]
scaling a cliff
臨高想心，
which can
[]
cause your body
能令汝形

名為
the

### Falseness of the third aggregate of conception (sañjña)

‘Your thought can
由汝念慮，
make your body move
使汝色身。

[]
both are not akin
身非念倫，
how can
@a@

obey thought‘s order
隨念所使。

種種取像。
Therefore, when
[]
mind stirs, body obeys
心生形取，
and both
[]
act in perfect unison.
與念相應。
When
[]
you are awake,
寤即想心。
your thinking mind works but when you
[]
sleep, dreams take
寐為諸夢。
the place of thoughts.
[]
Therefore,
則
you should know that

This is
名為
the

third
@b@

every discrimination {327}
汝諸行
@b@

does
[]
not stop
不停，
in a flash
@b@
of thought.

This is

第四
of your

false thinking.
妄想。

### Falseness of the fifth aggregate of consciousness (vijñāna)

‘If your
又汝
pure, bright, profound and subtle
精明湛不搖處，
(consciousness)
[]
is permanent,
名恒常者。
why (is it conditioned by and) does
[]
not go beyond
於身不出
your body‘s
[]
seeing,
見
hearing,
聞
feeling
覺
and
[]
knowing?
知。
If it is the real,
若實精真，
it should
[]
not allow
不容
itself to be affected by your
[]
false habits.
習妄。
@a@
何因汝等，
Very long ago
曾於昔年
you
[]
saw unusual things
睹一奇物。
but you then
經歷年歲，
forgot all about them.
憶妄俱無，
Why do you
於後忽然
@b@
覆睹前異，
remember
記憶
them
@c@
so vividly
宛然，
@c@
曾不遺失。
when you now
@a@
see them again?
@b@
This shows
則此
that the
[]
contamination
@a@
of your
[]
clear and still consciousness
精了湛
continues,
[]
@a@
不搖中，
instant after instant,
念念受熏，
in unbroken continuity;
[]
how can you
[]
ascertain this?
有何籌算。
Ānanda,
阿難
you should know that
當知。
this still
此湛
(Consciousness) is
[]
not Reality
非真。
and is
[]
like
如
a river
急流水，
which flows swiftly but
[]
seems to be still;
望如恬靜，
if you do not see it flow,
流急不見，
this does
[]
not mean
非是
that
[]
it stops.
無流。
If consciousness is
[]
not the source
若非想元，
of false thinking,
[]
how can
寧受
it be influenced by
[]
wrong habits?
妄習。
If you fail
非汝
to (wipe out separateness and) achieve
[]
@a@
六根
the
[]
uniform functioning
互用開合，
of all your
[]
six sense organs,
@a@
your false thinking
此之妄想
cannot
無時
be brought
[]
to an end.
得滅。
Therefore,
故
behind your
汝現在
seeing,
見
hearing,
聞
feeling
覺
and
[]
knowing,
知
there is
[]
chain of subtle
中串
worldly habits
習幾，
and within
[]
your
則
still consciousness
湛了內
there is something which seems
[]
not to but does
罔象虛無，
exist and which is the
[]
fifth
第五
@d@
顛倒
subtle state
微細精
of your
[]
false
@d@
thinking.
想。

‘Ānanda,
阿難。
all the five aggregates
是五受陰，
are created by this
[]
five-fold false thinking.
五妄想成。
As to
[]
their boundaries
@a@
about which
[]
you wish to know,
汝今欲知
[]
因界淺深。
form and voidness
唯色與空，
are the
是
boundaries
@a@
of the {328} aggregate of
[]
rūpa;

邊際。
receptiveness and non-receptiveness
唯觸及離，
of

是
sañjñā;
想
@a@

rise and fall
唯滅與生，
of

and the

return

‘The five aggregates
此五陰元，
arise by piling themselves
重疊生起。
upon one another. They
[]
originate
生因
from

all vanish

but
[]
in practice,

they are

wiped out gradually
非頓除，
due to the

force of habit.
因次第盡。
I have shown you
我已示汝
how to
[]
untie the six knots
劫波巾結，
in a cloth
[]
and all this should have been
[]
clear to you;
何所不明，
why do you

still ask me (about it)?
再此詣問。

‘You should
