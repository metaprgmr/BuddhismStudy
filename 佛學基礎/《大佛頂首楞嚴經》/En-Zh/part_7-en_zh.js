# The Six States of Living Beings in Saṃsāra

[]
說是語已。即時
@a@
阿難及諸大眾，
After hearing
得蒙
the
[]
Buddhas
如來
disclosure of
開示
the
[]
Sitātaprata‘s esoteric Seal,
密印般怛羅義。
and of
兼聞
@b@
此經
the
[]
Whole Truth,
了義
as the titles
名目。
of this sūtra,
@b@
Ānanda and the assembly
@a@
instantly awakened to
頓悟
(the state of)
[]
dhyāna,
禪那
the
[]
practice
修
of which could
[]
lead to the holy stages
進聖位。
and
[]
increase
增上
their understanding of the
[]
profound doctrine,
妙理，
so that they could
(心慮虛凝。)
wipe out
斷除
all the troubles
@a@
derived from (the first)
[]
six classes of delusion
@b@
in the three realms
三界
of existence.
[]
@b@
修心六品
@a@
微細煩惱。

Ānanda then
[]
rose from his seat,
即從座起，
prostrated himself with his head
頂禮
at the feet of the Buddha,
佛足，
brought his palms together
合掌恭敬
and said:
而白佛言：
‘O August and
大威德
World Honoured One,
世尊。
your compassionate voice
慈音
has revealed so skilfully
無遮。
to us
善開
@a@
眾生
the
[]
subtle delusions
微細沈惑。
of all living beings
@a@
for my great benefit, thereby {244}
[]
bringing
令
great comfort to
@b@
my body and mind.
我今日身心
@b@
快然，得大饒益。
World Honoured One,
世尊。
if this
若此
Bright and pure Absolute Mind
妙明真淨妙心，
were essentially perfect,
本來遍圓。
then even
如是乃至
the
[]
great earth,
大地
plants
草
and
[]
trees
木，
as well as
[]
wriggling worms
蠕動
and
[]
all beings possessing life
含靈，
would be the
[]
fundamental Bhūtatathatā
本元真如，
which is but
即是
the
[]
Tathāgata‘s
如來
real substance
@a@
in the state of
[]
Buddhahood.
成佛
@a@
真體。
If the Buddha‘s substance
佛體
were true and real,
真實，
how could
云何
there also be
復有
the
[]
world of
[]
hells,
地獄、
hungry ghosts,
餓鬼、
animals,
畜生、
asuras,
修羅、
men
人、
and
[]
devas?
天、
(等道。)
[]
World Honoured One,
世尊。
are these worlds
此道為復
fundamentally
本來
self-existent
自有。
or do they
為是
arise
@b@
because of
[]
living beings‘
眾生
vicious habit
妄習
of dwelling in falsehood?
[]
@b@
生起。

‘World Honoured One,
世尊。
let me illustrate what I mean.
[]
[]
如
The Bhikṣuṇī
@a@
“Fragrance of the Precious Lotus,”
寶蓮香
@a@
比丘尼，
after
[]
receiving the rules of
持
Bodhisattva discipline,
菩薩戒，
fornicated
私行婬欲。
and
[]
pretended
妄言
that
[]
it was
行婬
neither killing
非殺
nor stealing
非偷，
and was, therefore,
[]
not subject to
無有
karmic retribution.
業報。
As a result,
發是語已，
after
[]
her genital organ
先於女根
had been slowly
[]
scorched by the flame
生大猛火，
(of passion),
[]
[]
後於節節猛火燒然，
she
[]
fell into
墮
the
[]
unintermittent hell.
無間獄。
King Crystal
琉璃大王
[]
(善星比丘)琉璃為
massacred
誅
men of the Gautama clan,
瞿曇族姓。
and Bhikṣu
[]
Sanakṣatra
善星
wrongly preached
妄說
the
[]
annihilation of all things
一切法空。
(and so implied that the law of causality was invalid). Both as a result of their (evil) acts,
[]
fell into
生身陷入
the
[]
avīci hell.
阿鼻地獄。
Are these hells
此諸地獄，
really somewhere
為有定處，
or are they
為復
self-existing
自然，
for every sinner to suffer in them?
彼彼發業，各各私受。
Will you be compassionate enough
惟垂大慈，
to enlighten us
開發童蒙。
so that
[]
those who
令諸
observe the precepts
一切持戒眾生，
know what they imply
聞決定義，
[]
歡喜頂戴，
and
[]
do not break them?
謹潔無犯。

The Buddha said:
佛告阿難。
‘It is
[]
good
快哉
that you
[]
ask this
此問。
question {245}
[]
for
令
the benefit of
[]
all living beings
諸眾生
so that they
[]
cease to hold wrong views.
不入邪見。
Listen attentively
汝今諦聽。
to what
[]
I now tell you.
當為汝說。

‘Ānanda,
阿難。
all living beings
一切眾生
are fundamentally pure
實本真淨。
but
[]
because of
因
their
彼
wrong views,
妄見，
they have
[]
formed
@a@
vicious habits,
有妄習
@a@
生。
hence
因此
[]
分開
their inner
內分
and
[]
outer affections.
外分。

‘Ānanda,
阿難。
inner affection
內分
concerns
即是
their inwardnesses.
眾生分內。
Because of
因
the
[]
taint of desire,
諸愛染，
they
[]
give rise to
發起
wrong passions
妄情。
the
[]
accumulation
情積不休，
of which
[]
produces
能生
the
[]
water of craving.
愛水。
This is why
是故眾生，
the
[]
thought of good food
心憶珍羞，
makes the mouth water;
口中水出。
the
[]
thought of a predecessor
心憶前人，
whom one pities or hates
或憐或恨，
fills one‘s eyes with tears;
目中淚盈。
the
[]
craving for wealth
貪求財寶，
stirs one‘s heart
and
[]
心發
makes saliva flow
and
[]
愛涎，
the
[]
body sleek.
舉體光潤。
When the
[]
mind gives rise to
心著
sexual desire,
行婬，
the
[]
generative fluid flows
@a@
from
[]
the
[]
male and female organs.
男女二根，
@a@
自然流液。
Ānanda,
阿難。
although
[]
these desires differ,
諸愛雖別，
their manifestations
@b@
are all characterized by the
[]
secretion of water
流結
@b@
是同。
which, by nature,
[]
flows down hill instead of up.
潤濕不升，自然從墜。
This is
此名
inner affection.
內分。

‘Ānanda,
阿難。
outer affection
外分
concerns
即是
living beings externally.
眾生分外。
Their keen desires
因諸渴仰，
produce
發明
illusory thoughts
虛想。
which
[]
by continuous pursuit
想積不休
become overwhelming.
能生勝氣。
Thus
是故
[]
眾生，
the
[]
mind bent on
心持
strict observance of the
[]
precepts
禁戒，
makes the body light;
舉身輕清。
the
[]
mind concentrated on
心持
incantations
[]
(mantra)
咒
and mystic gestures
[]
(mudrā)
印，
gives
顧盻
a virile
雄
and
[]
resolute
毅。
air; the
[]
mind set on rebirth in the heaven
心欲生天，
of gods
[]
brings dreams
夢想
in which the practiser seems to
[]
fly upwards;
飛舉。
the
[]
mind concentrated
心存
on the Buddha-land
佛國，
causes holy realms
聖境
to appear;
冥現。
and
[]
real devotion to
事
a religious counsellor
[]
(kalyāṇamitra)
善知識，
leads to the
[]
willing sacrifice of
自輕
even one‘s
[]
own life.
身命。
Ānanda,
阿難。
although {246}
[]
these thoughts
諸想
differ,
雖別，
all these manifestations
@a@
are, by nature, characterized by
[]
a lightness of body
輕舉
@a@
是同。
which
[]
soars up
飛動
instead of
不
sinking down
沈，
so that
[]
they
[]
leap over
自然
their (present) states.
超越。
This is
此名
outer affection.
外分。

‘Ānanda,
阿難。
in the round of
一切世間
births and deaths
生死
in Saṃsāra,
相續。
birth
生
is caused by
從
the
[]
habits (of passions)
順習。
and
[]
death
死
by the flow of
從
(retributive)
[]
transformation.
變流。
(This is why)
[]
at the moment of death
臨命終時，
and
[]
before the heat completely
未捨
leaves the body,
煖觸，
all good and evil deeds of a lifetime
一生善惡
suddenly reappear to someone
俱時頓現，
who is dead but
死逆生順，
on the point of being reborn.
二習相交。

### The realm of devas

‘If his mind is
[]
wholly thoughtful,
純想即飛，
it will fly in the air and he will be
[]
reborn in heaven.
必生天上。
If in this flight
若飛心中，
it is
[]
filled with blessedness and wisdom
兼福兼慧，
strongly sustained by his pure vow,
及與淨願，
it will
[]
open to let him behold
自然心開，
the
[]
pure lands
@a@
of
見
all Buddhas
@b@
in the ten directions;
十方
@b@
佛，
@a@
一切淨土，
he will be
[]
@c@
隨願
reborn there
往生。
as a result of his vow.
@c@

## The realm of seers (ṛṣi) and spirits

‘If his mind is
[]
more thoughtful than passionate,
情少想多，
it will
[]
not
@a@
be light enough for him to
[]
fly to distant places;
輕舉
@a@
非遠。
he will be
[]
reborn as a flying ṛṣi,
即為飛仙，
a powerful king of ghosts,
大力鬼王、
a flying yakṣa
飛行夜叉、
or
[]
an earthbound rākṣasa.
地行羅剎，
He will be able to
[]
roam
遊於
freely
@b@
in the heavens of
[]
the
[]
four deva kings.
四天，
@b@
所去無礙。
If he is
其中若有
good natured
善願
and
[]
has taken a vow
善心，
to protect my Dharma
護持我法。
and
[]
those who observe the precepts,
或護禁戒，隨持戒人。
repeat the mantras,
或護神咒，隨持咒者。
meditate
或護禪定，
and
[]
realize patient endurance,
保綏法忍。
he will dwell
是等親住
beneath the throne of the
@c@
Tathāgata. {247}
如來
@c@
座下。

### The realm of human beings

‘If his
[]
thoughts and passions
情想
are in equal proportions,
均等，
he will
[]
neither rise
不飛
nor sink,
不墜，
but will be
[]
reborn in the realm of
生於
human beings
人間。
where
[]
his intelligence comes from
@a@
the
[]
clearness of his thoughts
想明
@a@
斯聰。
and
[]
his stupidity from
@b@
the
[]
dullness of his passions.
情幽
@b@
斯鈍。

### The realm of animals

‘If his
[]
passions exceed his thoughts,
情多想少，
he will be
[]
reborn in the realm of
流入
animals
橫生，
where
[]
great passions
重
create
為
beasts with hair and fur
毛群，
and
[]
mild passions
輕
produce
為
winged and feathered creatures.
羽族。

### The realm of hungry ghosts

‘If his passions and thoughts are in the
[]
proportion of seven to three,
七情三想，
he will
[]
sink into
沈下
the
[]
wheel of water
水輪，
close to the region of fire,
生於火際，
will endure intense heat
受氣猛火，
and be
[]
reborn as a hungry ghost
身為餓鬼，
whose
[]
body is constantly
常被
scorched by heat
焚燒，
and
[]
drowned in water,
水能害己，
so that he will
[]
suffer from hunger and thirst
無食無飲，
for
[]
hundreds and thousands of aeons.
經百千劫。

### The realm of hells

‘If his passions and thoughts are in the
[]
proportion of nine to one,
九情一想，
he will
[]
sink into
下
the
[]
wheel of fire
洞火輪，
and be
[]
reborn where wind and fire meet.
身入風火二交過地，
He will dwell in the intermittent hell if his passions are great,
輕生有間，重生無間，(二種地獄。)
and
[]
@a@
純情即沈，
in the avīci hell
入阿鼻獄。
if he is completely dominated
[]
by extremely violent ones.
@a@
If in addition
若沈心中，
he slanders the Mahāyāna,
有謗大乘，
breaks the Buddha‘s precepts,
毀佛禁戒，
distorts the {248} Dharma
誑妄
when preaching it
說法，
to deceive his patrons
虛貪信施，
for selfish gain or for fame,
濫膺恭敬，
and commits the
[]
five rebellious acts
五逆
and
[]
ten grave sins
十重，
he will be
[]
reborn (in turn)
更生
in all
十方
the
[]
avīci hells.
阿鼻地獄。

‘Although the above are
[]
self-inflicted retributions
@a@
resulting from individual evil deeds,
循造惡業，
@a@
雖則自招。
all sinners
眾
endure
[]
the
[]
same kinds
同分中，
of suffering which originate
[]
from
兼
(the same)
有
concurrent causes.
元地。

# The Ten Causes & Six Effects in the Realm of Hells
## The Ten Karmic Causes of the Realm of Hells

‘Ānanda,
阿難。
these (retributions)
此等皆是
come from the karmic acts
@a@
of living beings
彼諸眾生
@a@
自業所感。
who
[]
create ten karmic causes
造十習因。
by their vicious habits and so
[]
suffer from
受
six
六
kinds of retribution.
交報。

### The habit of sexual desire

‘Ānanda, what are these ten causes?
云何十因。阿難。

[]
一者、
Lust grows into a habit
婬習交接，
because of
發於
sexual intercourse
相磨。
in which
[]
two people
[]
caress each other
研磨不休，
thereby
如是
producing
故有
heat
大猛火光，
that in turn
[]
stimulates desire.
於中發動。
This is
[]
like
如
the
[]
heat caused
@a@
by rubbing the hands together.
人以手自相摩觸，
@a@
煖相現前。
The two habits from karma
二習相然，
and lust stimulate each other and
[]
cause
故有
visions of
[]
hot iron beds
鐵床
on
[]
hot copper
銅柱
supports.
諸事。
Hence
是故
all Buddhas
十方一切如來，
regard
色目
sexual intercourse
行婬，
as a {249}
同名
burning fire of desire
欲火。
and
[]
all Bodhisattvas
菩薩
avoid carnality
見欲，
as if
如
it was a fiery pit.
避火坑。

### The habit of craving

[]
二者、
‘Craving grows into a habit
貪習交計，
because of
發於
grasping
相吸。
which is a kind of
[]
suction,
吸攬
which
[]
in time
不止，
[]
如是
creates
故有
the illusion of
[]
cold, frost, chill
積寒堅冰，
and shivering.
於中凍冽。
This is
[]
like
如
the
[]
cold sensation felt
@a@
when
[]
one breathes in through pursed lips.
人以口吸縮風氣，
@a@
有冷觸生。
The combination of karma
二習相陵，
and craving leads to retribution in the form of suffering expressed by
[]
[]
故有
crying out against biting cold
吒吒、波波、羅羅、
and shown by (the skin turning)
[]
blue, red or white.
青赤白蓮、寒冰、
[]
等事。
Hence
是故
all Buddhas
十方一切如來，
regard
色目
craving
多求，
as the water of greed
同名貪水。
and
[]
all Bodhisattvas
菩薩
avoid
見
it
貪，
as
如
they would
避
a sea of pestilential vapour.
瘴海。

### The habit of arrogance

[]
三者、
‘Arrogance grows into a habit
慢習交陵，
because of
發於
abuse
相恃。
which manifests by the
[]
oppression
馳流
(of others), which
[]
in time
不息，
[]
如是
creates
故有
the (illusion of)
[]
restless waves
騰逸奔波，
which
[]
build up a volume of water.
積波為水。
This is
[]
like
如
licking one‘s mouth to make it water.
人口舌自相綿味，因而水發。
The two habits from karma
二習相鼓，
and arrogance stimulate each other and
[]
create
故有
(visions of)
[]
rivers of blood,
血河、
(hot) ashes,
灰河、
burning sand,
熱沙、
poisonous seas
毒海、
and
[]
molten copper
融銅、
poured on the sinner‘s tongue.
灌吞諸事。
And so
是故
all Buddhas
十方一切如來，
regard
色目
self-importance
我慢，
as
名
the
[]
water of stupidity
飲癡水。
and
[]
all Bodhisattvas
菩薩
avoid
見
it
慢，
as
如
they would
避
drowning.
巨溺。

### The habit of anger

[]
四者、
‘Anger grows into a habit
瞋習交衝，
because of
發於
irritation
相忤。
which manifests as
[]
stubbornness
忤結
which
[]
in time
不息，
inflames the heart
心熱發火，
whose {250} heat
[]
turns the vital breath into metal;
鑄氣為金。
[]
如是
hence
故有
the illusions of
[]
hills of knives,
刀山、
iron posts,
鐵梱、
trees and
劍樹、
wheels of swords,
劍輪、
axes, halberds,
斧鉞、
and
[]
spears saws.
鎗鋸。
This is
[]
like
如
a man
人
pushed by his obstinacy
@a@
to avenge a wrong.
銜冤，
@a@
殺氣飛動。
The two habits from karma
二習相擊，
and anger stimulate each other and
[]
create
故有
visions of
[]
castration,
宮
hacking,
割
beheading,
斬
chopping,
斫，
wounding,
剉
mutilating,
剌
bludgeoning
槌
and
[]
striking.
擊
[]
諸事。
This is like a man flying into a rage and ready to kill to redress a wrong.
[]
Hence
是故
all Buddhas
十方一切如來，
regard
色目
hatred
瞋恚，
as
名
a sharp sword
利刀劍。
and
[]
all Bodhisattvas
菩薩
flee from
見
it
瞋，
as
如
from
避
their own execution.
誅戮。

### The habit of deceitfulness

[]
五者、
‘Deceitfulness grows into a habit
詐習交誘，
because of
發於
enticement
相調。
which manifests as
[]
deceit
引起
which
[]
in time
不住，
[]
如是
creates
故有
(illusions of)
[]
cords,
繩
sticks,
木
ropes
絞
and
[]
cangues
校。
that restrain the sinner. This is
[]
like
如
a field flooded
水浸田。
for growing grass and plants.
草木生長。
The two habits from karma
二習相延，
and deception sustain each other and create more and more evil deeds that
[]
deserve punishment with
故有
fetters,
杻械
locks,
枷鎖
whips,
鞭
staves,
杖
birches
檛
and
[]
cudgels.
棒
[]
諸事。
And so,
是故
all Buddhas
十方一切如來，
regard
色目
deceitfulness
奸偽，
as
同名
harmful as calumny
讒賊。
and
[]
all Bodhisattvas
菩薩
avoid
見
it
詐，
as
如
they would
畏
a wolf.
豺狼。

### The habit of lying

[]
六者、
‘Lying grows into a habit
誑習交欺，
because of
發於
beguilement
相罔。
which manifests as
[]
fraud,
誣罔
which
[]
in time
不止，
ends in
飛心
treachery.
造奸。
This creates
如是故有
(illusions of)
[]
filth such as dust,
塵土
excrement
屎
and
[]
urine.
尿，
[]
穢汙不淨。
This is
[]
like
如
dust blown by the wind
塵隨風，
which screens everything.
各無所見。
The two habits from karma
二習相加，
and lies intensify each other and
[]
end in
故有
suffering from drowning,
沒溺
tossing,
騰擲，
flying,
飛
dropping,
墜
drifting {251}
漂
and
[]
sinking.
淪
[]
諸事。
Hence
是故
all Buddhas
十方一切如來，
regard
色目
lying
欺誑，
as
同名
harmful as plundering and killing
劫殺。
and
[]
all Bodhisattvas
菩薩
avoid
見
it
誑，
as
如
they would stepping on
踐
venomous snakes.
蛇虺。

### The habit of resentment

[]
七者、
‘Resentment grows into a habit
怨習交嫌，
because of
發於
aversion
銜恨。
which manifests as malice.
[]
This creates
如是故有
(illusions of)
[]
being stoned,
飛石，
catapulted,
投瀝，
shut in a prison van,
柙貯車檻，
trapped,
甕盛
bagged and struck.
囊撲。
This is
[]
like
如
a mischief-maker
陰毒人，
always with evil designs.
懷抱畜惡。
The two habits from karma
二習相吞，
and resentment combine and result in
[]
punishment by
故有
being tossed
投
and
[]
hurled about,
擲
seized,
擒
apprehended,
捉，
struck
擊射
and
[]
shot.
拋撮
[]
諸事。
And so
是故
all Buddhas
十方一切如來，
regard
色目
resentment
怨家，
as
名
an evil spirit
違害鬼。
and
[]
all Bodhisattvas
菩薩
avoid
見
it
怨，
as
如
they would
飲
poisoned wine.
鴆酒。

### The habit of wrong views

[]
八者、
‘Wrong views grow into habit
見習交明，
because of misinterpretation,
[]
which covers
如
(the five misconceptions
(薩迦耶，)
from) the reality of
(見戒禁取，)
the
[]
ego and objects
(邪悟諸業，)
down to rigorous
(發於違拒，)
ascetic prohibitions.
(出生相反。)
This causes the misunderstanding of karmic effects due to rejection of the real and attachment to the unreal.
[]
[]
如是
Hence
故有
the (illusion of)
[]
judgement with proofs of evidence
王使主吏，證執文籍。
(which cannot be denied),

[]
if they
若於先心，
wipe out both suffering and happiness
雙厭苦樂，
thereby
[]
developing a renouncing mind,
精研捨心，
which
[]
in time ensures their complete renunciation,
相續不斷。
both their bodies and minds will be eliminated
圓窮捨道，身心俱滅。
and with them
[]
all mental troubles.
心慮灰凝，
But because their practice is based on the samsaric idea
[]
(of birth and death) as a point of departure,
(經五百劫。) 是人既以生滅為因。
they will
[]
not, for five hundred aeons, realize their permanent nature.
不能發明不生滅性。
The reason is that
[]
in every kalpa they can only succeed during its first half
初半劫滅。
in wiping out all their thoughts
[]
which, however,
[]
will
[]
recur during its second half
後半劫生。
(because of the wrong starting point).
[]
This is
如是一類，名
the
[]
heaven of thoughtless devas
[]
(Asañjñisattva).
無想天。

‘Ānanda,
阿難。
these four heavens
此四勝流，
in the state beyond
[]
all worldly suffering and happiness
一切世間諸苦樂境
which can
[]
no more stir them.
所不能動。
But they have
[]
not yet reached the true state
雖非無為真不動地。
of transcendental (wu wei) immutability because they (still)
[]
preserve the notion of achievement.
有所得心，
For this efficient achievement,
功用純熟。
they are called
名
the
[]
fourth region of the dhyāna heavens.
為四禪。

### The five heavens from which there is no return

‘Further,
[]
Ānanda,
阿難。
above the fourth region of the dhyāna {270}
(此中復有)
heavens there are
[]
five heavens from which there is no return,
五不還天。
whose devas
[]
have completely cut off all habits contracted
於下界中九品習氣，俱時滅盡。
through the nine types of delusion of each of the lower heavens. They are thus
[]
beyond suffering happiness
苦樂雙忘。
and
[]
dwell no more in these inferior heavens.
下無卜居。
Hence their present abodes
[]
set up by their achievement of renunciation.
故於捨心眾同分中，安立居處。
(They are):
[]

1.
[]
‘Ānanda,
阿難。
with the
[]
complete elimination of both suffering and happiness,
苦樂兩滅，
the
[]
struggling mind ceases
鬥心不交。
to arise in this heaven
[]
which is free from trouble
[]
and is called
如是一類，名
Avṛha.
無煩天。

2.  ‘There remains now the
[]
solitary renouncing mind
機括獨行，
that
[]
no longer confronts objects
研交無地。
in this heaven which is free from the heat (of minor trouble)
[]
and is called
如是一類，名
Atapa.
無熱天。

3.
[]
‘All the worlds in the ten directions
十方世界，
are now
[]
clearly perceived as perfectly still
妙見圓澄，
without even a speck of impurity in this heaven of excellent perception,
更無塵象一切沈垢。

如是一類，名
Sudarśana.
善見天。

4.
[]
‘The essence of seeing now manifests
精見現前，
and
[]
dissolves all (subtle) hindrances in this heaven of excellent manifestations
陶鑄無礙。
called
如是一類，名
Sudṛśa.
善現天。

5.
[]
‘The utmost subtlety of form
究竟群幾，
leads to its extreme limit
窮色性性，
where
[]
starts boundless space
入無邊際。
in this ultimate heaven of (finest) form,
[]
called
如是一類，名
Akaniṣṭha.
色究竟天。

‘Ānanda,
阿難。
these (five) heavens from
[]
which there is no return
此不還天，
are
[]
imperceptible to the deva kings of the four dhyāna {271} heavens
彼諸四禪四位天王，
who
[]
only hear of their existence
獨有欽聞，
but
[]
cannot see them.
不能知見。
They are
[]
like those holy sites (bodhimaṇḍalas) situated deep in the mountains,
如今世間曠野深山，聖道場地，
which
[]
are the abodes of Arhats
皆阿羅漢所住持故，
and
[]
which no worldling can see.
世間麤人所不能見。

‘Ānanda,
阿難。
the
[]
above are the eighteen heavens of form
是十八天，
whose devas are solitaries beyond all desires,
獨行無交，
but
[]
are still hindered by their forms.
未盡形累。
These heavens are,
自此已還，
therefore,
[]
in the realm of form.
名為色界。

## The Four Heavens of the Formless Realm of Pure Spirit (Arūpadhātu)
### The state of the Great Arhat

‘Further,
復次
Ānanda,
阿難。
the
[]
region above the top of the realm of form
從是有頂色邊際中，
is divided into two paths.
其間復有二種歧路。
If the renouncing minds of these devas create (transcendental) wisdom,
若於捨心發明智慧，
the
[]
light of which is perfectly penetrating,
慧光圓通，
they will leap over saṃsāra
便出塵界，
to become Arhats
成阿羅漢，
(later) to enter the Bodhisattva state.
入菩薩乘。
They are called
如是一類，名
Great Arhats whose minds are turned towards Mahāyāna.
為迴心大阿羅漢。

### The four heavens beyond form

1. ‘On the other hand,
[]
if after acquiring a renouncing mind,
若在捨心，
they relinquish this achievement
捨厭成就。
and feel that their bodies are no longer obstructive,
覺身為礙，
they will remove all obstacles to enter the void.
銷礙入空。
This is
如是一類，名
the heaven of boundless emptiness
[]
(Ākāśānantyāyatana).
為空處。

2.
[]
‘If after wiping out all obstruction,
諸礙既銷，
they keep away from boundless voidness,
無礙無滅。
they will retain only the subtle half {272} of (kliṣṭa-) mano-vijñāna in the ālaya.
其中唯留阿賴耶識。全於末那半分微細。
This is
如是一類，名
the heaven of boundless consciousness.
[]
(Vijñānānantyāyatana).
為識處。

3.
[]
‘With the elimination of both form and voidness
空色既亡，
and the additional eradication of consciousness,
識心都滅。
all the ten directions will be completely still,
十方寂然，
merging into nothingness.
迴無攸往。
This heaven is called
如是一類，名
Akiñcanyāyatana.
無所有處。

4.
[]
‘Consciousness now becomes immovable awareness,
識性不動，
thus ending all further exhaustive search.
以滅窮研，
As a result, the
[]
inexhaustible reveals the exhaustible
於無盡中發宣盡性。
which seems to, yet does not, stay
如存不存。
and which seems to, yet does not, end.
若盡非盡。
This is
如是一類，名
the heaven of devas who are neither thoughtful nor thoughtless
[]
(Naivasaṃjñānasaṃjñāyatana).
為非想非非想處。

### The Anāgāmin stage

‘Though the devas of the four heavens beyond form succeed in
[]
looking exhaustively into the void,
此等窮空，
they
[]
fail to realize the absolute voidness
不盡空理。
of (immaterial) noumenon. They all come from the five heavens of form from which
[]
there is no return
從不還天
and if they do
[]
 not stray from the holy Way,
聖道窮者，
they are called
如是一類，名
(Anāgāmins of) Arhatship
不迴心鈍阿羅漢。
whose dull minds are not turned towards Mahāyāna.
[]

‘However,
[]
if they follow thoughtless devas of the heterodox way
若從無想諸外道天，
and stay in this inexhaustible voidness,
窮空不歸，
they will delight in samsaric heavens
迷漏
and will be
[]
deprived
無
of the chance of
[]
hearing the Dharma;
聞，
they will finally be
[]
turned back
便入
to the wheel of
[]
births and deaths. {273}
輪轉。

‘Ānanda,
阿難。
all the devas in these heavens
是諸天上各各天人，
were once worldly men
則是凡夫
whose
[]
reward caused their rebirth
業果酬答，
there, and after
[]
enjoying its fruit,
答盡
they will have to
[]
return to Saṃsāra.
入輪。
However,
[]
their rulers (devarāja)
彼之天王，
are Bodhisattvas
即是菩薩
who, in their practice of Samādhi,
遊三摩提，
appear in their heavens which they use as paths for
[]
 their progressive
漸次增進，
advance towards Buddhahood.
迴向聖倫所修行路。

‘Ānanda,
阿難。
the devas in
[]
these four heavens
是四空天，
beyond form have
[]
wiped out
@a@
all traces of
[]
body and mind.
身心
@a@
滅盡，
As their still

(dhyāna) nature
定性
has appeared,

free from

all retribution
業果

[]
forms.
色。
Hence this is
從此逮終，名
the
[]
region beyond form.
無色界。

‘All this
此皆
comes from their being

not clear
不了
about the
[]
profound mind of Bodhi
妙覺明心。
and

because of their preservation of
@a@
accumulated thoughts,
積妄

they create the

three illusory realms of existence
妄有三界。
through

the

seven states;

hence they are living beings

補特伽羅
in the worlds

1.

‘If a hungry ghost,

‘If a deva,

the region

near
鄰於

reborn from a womb
@a@

another inferior class of asuras

at night.

and are
[]
like flowers in the sky within their profound, perfect, bright and non-creating fundamental minds.
於妙圓明無作本心，皆如空華，元無所著。
Essentially they are not in bondage to anything, and
[]
are (the product of) falsehood
但一虛妄，
which has neither root nor clue.
更無根緒。

‘Ānanda,
阿難。
these living beings
此等眾生，
are
[]
unaware
不識
of their
[]
fundamental minds
本心，
and so
[]
suffer from
受此
this round of births and deaths in

saṃsāra.
輪迴，
If they have passed

countless aeons
經無量劫，
without realizing
不得

true and pure

無殺盜婬。
Where

these acts exist

the

realm of hungry ghosts
鬼倫。

they do not

the

realm of devas.
天趣。
The

presence {275} or absence
有無
of these three evils

相傾，

起

such evils as

killing, stealing and carnality?
殺盜婬事。

‘Ānanda,
阿難。
if an individual does
[]
not abstain from
不斷
these
[]
three evil deeds,
三業，
he will
[]
suffer from evil consequences.
各各有私。
If a
[]
group of individuals commit them,
因各各私。
they will all endure the

same suffering
眾私
in the same place
同分，

cannot be said to be non-existent.
非無定處。
However, this (place)
