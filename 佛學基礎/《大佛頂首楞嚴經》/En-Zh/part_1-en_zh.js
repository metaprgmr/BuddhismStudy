{V1}

Thus have I heard.
如是我聞。
Once
一時
the Buddha stayed in
佛在
the Jetavana vihāra near Śravāsti
室羅筏城，祇桓精舍。
with twelve hundred and fifty bhikṣus,
與大比丘眾，千二百五十人俱。
(most of whom) were
[]
great arhats who had crossed the stream of transmigration.
皆是無漏大阿羅漢。
They upheld His teaching firmly,
佛子住持，善超諸有。
could leap
[]
over all realms of existence
能於國土，
and had
[]
achieved
成就
the respect-inspiring deportment
威儀。
which was held in great esteem throughout the country. They
[]
followed the Buddha
從佛
to turn the Wheel of the Law
轉輪，
and were
[]
qualified to hand down His Dharma.
妙堪遺囑。
Being self-disciplined,
嚴淨毗尼，
they set a good example in the three worlds
弘範三界。
in which they
[]
appeared in countless transformation bodies
應身無量，
to deliver living beings
度脫眾生。
and
[]
to save future generations from defilement.
拔濟未來，越諸塵累。
They were
[]
led by
@a@
[]
其名曰，
Śāriputra the Wise,
大智舍利弗，
Mahā-Maudgalyāyana,
摩訶目犍連，
Mahā-KauṣÒhila,
摩訶拘絺羅，
Pūrṇamaitrā-vaṇīputra,
富樓那彌多羅尼子，
Subhūti
須菩提，
and
[]
Upaniṣad.
優波尼沙陀
@a@
等，而為上首。
There were
[]
also countless pratyeka-buddhas
復有無量辟支
who (since they had conquered their old habits)
[]
had nothing more to learn,
無學，
(yet)
并其初心，
came to the Buddha’s vihāra
同來佛所。
determined to seek (ultimate) Truth. Now the
[]
summer retreat
@a@
had just finished
[]
when the bhikṣus
屬諸比丘
took stock of their errors and mistakes
@b@
@a@
休夏
@b@
自恣。
and when the
[]
Bodhisattvas from the ten directions,
十方菩薩
determined to wipe out
咨決
their remaining
[]
doubts and suspicions,
心疑。
reverently awaited the Teaching
欽奉慈嚴，
in their search
[]
for its esoteric meaning.
將求密義。
And so
即時
the Tathāgata
如來
arranged His seat
敷座
and
[]
sat with crossed legs to {24}
宴安，
[]
為諸會中，
proclaim the profound (Doctrine).
宣示深奧。
Such a
[]
Dharma feast to purify the assembly
法筵清眾，
had
[]
never taken place before
得未曾有。
and His
[]
melodious voice
迦陵仙音，
was heard is
[]
the ten quarters.
遍十方界。
Led by Mañjuśrī,
@c@
a number of
[]
Bodhisattvas as countless as sand grains in the Ganges,
恒沙菩薩，
had come to the holy place.
來聚道場。
@c@
文殊師利而為上首。

Meanwhile,
時
King Prasenajit
波斯匿王，
who was
[]
keeping the anniversary of his father’s death
為其父王諱日
by offering vegetarian food to him,
營齋。
came personally to
[]
invite the Tathāgata
@a@
to the inner palace
請佛宮掖，
@a@
自迎如來，
for a royal feast of best and rarest delicacies,
廣設珍羞無上妙味，
to which he
[]
also invited the great Bodhisattvas in the assembly.
兼復親延諸大菩薩。
In the city
城中
the elders and devotees
復有長者居士
also
同時
offered food to
飯
members of the Order
僧，
and
[]
reverently waited for the Buddha’s arrival.
佇佛來應。

# Ānanda’s Weakness — The Reason for this Sermon

Commanded by the Buddha,
佛敕
Mañjuśrī
大殊，
took the Bodhisattvas
分領菩薩
and arhats
及阿羅漢，
to the royal feast.
應諸齋主。
Ānanda, however,
唯有阿難，
had not come back
@a@
from a distant engagement,
先受別請，
@a@
遠遊未還，
and so
[]
was not among the invited.
不遑僧次。
He was returning to the vihāra alone
@b@
without his superior
既無上座，
or teacher,
及阿闍黎。
@b@
途中獨歸，其日無供。
[]
即時阿難，
and
[]
bowl in hand
執持應器，
went begging from door to door
@c@
in a nearby town.
於所遊城，
@c@
次第循乞。
He
[]
intended to call first on
心中初求
a donor who
@d@
had
[]
not given food to the monks
最後檀越，
that day,
[]
@d@
以為齋主。
regardless of
[]
whether or not
無問
he was
[]
virtuous,
淨穢，
a noble
剎利尊姓，
or an outcast.
及旃陀羅。
In his practice of universal compassion,
方行等慈，
he did not especially choose a poor man
不擇微賤。
as his patron.
[]
He
[]
wanted to help
發意圓成，
all living beings
一切眾生，
earn countless merits,
無量功德。
for he had
阿難已
seen the Buddha
知如來世尊，
scold
訶
Subhūti
須菩提，
and Mahākāśyapa
及大迦葉，
who, though
[]
being arhats,
為阿羅漢，
could not realize
心不
universal mind
均平。
(when begging {25} for food).
[]
He very much admired His teaching
欽仰如來，
which had
[]
eliminated all his doubts and suspicions
@e@
in this respect.
開闡無遮，
@e@
度諸疑謗。
So when he
[]
reached the town’s gate,
經彼城隍，
he walked slowly
徐步郭門。
adjusting his mien
嚴整威儀，
to the rules of discipline.
肅恭齋法。
As he
[]
went begging for food,
爾時阿難，因乞食次，
he came to
[]
a house of prostitution
經歷婬室，
where
[]
Mātaṅgī, (a low caste woman)
遭大幻術。摩登伽女，
succeeded,
[]
by means of Kapila magic,
以娑毗迦羅先梵天咒，
in
[]
drawing
攝
him close to her
[]
sensual body on the mat,
入婬席。
so that he was
[]
on the point of
(婬躬撫摩，)
breaking the rules of pure living.
將毀戒體。

But the
[]
Buddha was aware of all this
如來知彼婬術所加，
and,
[]
after the royal feast,
齋畢
He returned to the vihāra
旋歸。
with the
[]
king,
王
princes and elders
及大臣長者居士，
who
(俱來隨佛，)
wished to hear about the essentials of the Dharma.
願聞法要。
He then
於時世尊，
sent out from the top of His head
頂放
a bright and triumphant multicoloured light
百寶無畏光明，
within which appeared
光中出生
@f@
千葉寶蓮，
a transformation Buddha
有佛化身，
seated, with crossed legs,
結跏趺坐，
on a
[]
thousand-petalled lotus.
@f@
The Buddha then
[]
repeated the transcendental mantra
宣說神咒。
and ordered Mañjuśrī to use it
敕文殊師利將咒往護。
to overcome the magic
惡咒消滅。
and
[]
to bring Ānanda with Mātaṅgī
提獎阿難，及摩登伽，
to the vihāra.
歸來佛所。

# Meditative Study of All as Void (Śamatha)

When Ānanda
阿難
saw the Buddha,
見佛，
he prostrated himself
頂禮
at His feet,
[]
weeping bitterly
悲泣。
and saying that,
[]
since the time without beginning,
恨無始來，
though he had
[]
heard much about the Dharma,
一向多聞，
he still could
[]
not acquire
未全
the transcendental power of the Tao. {26}
道力。

Earnestly he
殷勤
asked the Buddha to teach
啟請，
the preliminary expedients in the practice of śamatha, samāpatti and dhyāna
@a@
which
[]
led to the enlightenment of
@b@
all Buddhas in the ten directions.
十方如來
@b@
得成菩提，
@a@
妙奢摩他，三摩，禪那，最初方便。
There was also present
於時復有
a great number of
[]
Bodhisattvas, as countless as sand grains in the Ganges,
恒沙菩薩，
and great arhats and pratyeka-buddhas
及諸十方大阿羅漢，辟支佛等，
who had come wishing to hear about the Dharma.
俱願樂聞。
They all waited silently
退坐默然。
and reverently for the holy Teaching.
承受聖旨。

# Wiping Out the Five Aggregates & Eight Consciousnesses to Expose the Unreality of Ego
## Probing into the false mind to wipe out the first two aggregates and first five consciousnesses

The Buddha said to Ānanda:
佛告阿難：
‘You and I are close relatives.
汝我同氣，情均天倫。
Tell me
[]
what you saw in the assembly
@a@
when you made up your mind
當初發心，
@a@
於我法中，見何勝相，
to give up all worldly feelings
頓捨世間
of affection and love
深重恩愛。
(to follow me)?’
[]
Ānanda replied:
阿難白佛：
‘I saw
我見
the thirty-two excellent characteristics
如來三十二相，勝妙殊絕，
and the
[]
shining crystal-like form of the Buddha’s body.
形體映徹猶如琉璃。
I thought
常自思惟，
that all
[]
this could not be
此相非是
the result of desire and love,
欲愛所生。
for
何以故？
desire creates foul and fetid impurities
欲氣麤濁，腥臊交遘，
like pus and blood
膿血雜亂，
which mingle and
[]
cannot produce
不能發生
the wondrous brightness of His golden-hued body,
勝淨妙明紫金光聚。
in admiration
是以渴仰，
of which
[]
I shaved my head to follow Him.’
從佛剃落。
The Buddha said:
佛言：
[]
善哉，
‘Ānanda
阿難！
and
[]
all of you should know {27}
汝等當知
that living beings,
一切眾生，
since the time without beginning,
從無始來，
have been
[]
subject continuously to birth and death
生死相續，
because they do not know
皆由不知
the permanent True Mind
常住真心
whose
[]
substance
@a@
is, by
[]
nature, pure and bright.
性淨明
@a@
體，
They have
[]
relied on false thinking
用諸妄想。
which is not Reality
此想不真，
so that the wheel of saṃsāra turns.
故有輪轉。
Now if you wish to study
汝今欲研
the unsurpassed Supreme Bodhi
無上菩提
to realize this bright nature,
真發明性，
you should
應當
answer my questions straightforwardly.
直心詶我所問。
All Buddhas in the ten directions
十方如來
trod the same path
同一道故，
to escape from
出離
birth and death
生死，
because of their
皆以
straightforward minds,
直心。
with the same
[]
straightforwardness of mind and speech
心言直故，
from start to finish
如是乃至終始地位，
without a
中間永無
trace of crookedness.
諸委曲相。

‘Ānanda,
阿難！
[]
我今問汝。
when you developed that mind
當汝發心
because of
緣於
the Buddha’s
如來
thirty-two excellent characteristics,
三十二相，
tell me
[]
what saw and loved them.’
將何所見，誰為愛樂。

Ānanda replied:
阿難白佛言：
‘World Honoured One,
世尊！
my love
如是愛樂，
came from the use of my mind,
用我心目，
my eyes seeing
由目觀見如來勝相，
and my mind admiring them,
心生愛樂。
so that it was set on
故我發心，
relinquishing
願捨
birth and death.’
生死。
The Buddha continued:
佛告阿難：
‘As you just said,
如汝所說，
your love was
真所愛樂，
caused by your mind and eyes
因於心目。
but
[]
if you do not know where
若不識知
your mind and eyes really are,
心目所在，
you will never be able to
則不能得
destroy delusion.
降伏塵勞。
For instance,
譬如
when the country is invaded by bandits,
@a@
the king,
國王，
@a@
為賊所侵，
before sending his soldiers
發兵
to destroy them,
討除。
should first
是兵要當
know where they are.
知賊所在。
That which
[]
causes you to transmigrate
使汝流轉，
without interruption,
[]
comes from defects in your mind and eyes.
心目為咎。
Now tell me
吾今問汝，
where your mind and eyes are.’
唯心與目，今何所在。

Ānanda replied:
阿難白佛言：
‘World Honoured One,
世尊！
all living {28} beings born in the world
一切世間
through the
[]
ten types of birth
十種異生，
hold that
同將
this knowing mind is in the body.
識心居在身內。
As I look at
縱觀
the lotus-blue eyes of the Buddha,
如來青蓮華眼，
I see that they
[]
are on His face.
亦在佛面。
Hence my understanding that
我今觀此
my eyes
浮根四塵，
are on my face
祇在我面。
whereas
[]
my knowing mind
如是識心，
is in my body.
實居身內。

The Buddha asked:
佛告阿難：
‘Now as you
汝今現
sit
坐
in this hall,
如來講堂，
where do you see Jetavana park?’
觀祇陀林今何所在？

Ānanda replied:
[]
‘World Honoured One,
世尊！
this great hall is in Jetavana park
此大重閣清淨講堂，在給孤園。
which is,
[]
therefore, outside the hall.’
今祇陀林實在堂外。

The Buddha asked:
[]
‘What do you see first in this hall.’
阿難！汝今堂中先何所見。

Ānanda replied:
[]
‘World Honoured One,
世尊！
in this hall,
我在堂中
I see first the Tathāgata,
先見如來，
then the assembly,
次觀大眾。
and only when looking outside
如是外望，
do I see the park.’
方矚林園。

The Buddha asked:
(阿難！)
‘When you see the park,
汝矚林園，
what causes you to do so?’
因何有見。

Ānanda replied:
世尊！
It is because
(此大講堂，)
the doors and windows are open
戶牖開豁。
that
[]
I, though sitting in this hall,
故我在堂
see the park outside.’
得遠瞻見。

The Buddha then
爾時世尊，
[]
在大眾中，
extended His golden-hued arm
舒金色臂，
and touched Ānanda’s head with His hand,
摩阿難頂。
saying:
告示
[]
阿難及諸大眾：
‘There is a samādhi
有三摩提，
called the all-embracing Supreme Śuraṅgama,
名大佛頂首楞嚴王，(具足萬行，)
a gateway
@a@
through which
[]
all Buddhas in the ten directions
十方如來
@a@
一門
attained to
超出
the wondrous Majestic Path.
妙莊嚴路。
Ānanda,
[]
listen now attentively.’
汝今諦聽。

Ānanda
阿難
prostrated himself
頂禮，
at the Buddha’s feet and
[]
knelt to receive
伏受
the holy instruction.
慈旨。

The Buddha said:
佛告阿難：
‘If you (are right) that,
如汝所言，
while sitting in this hall,
身在講堂，
you see the park outside
@a@
through open doors and windows
戶牖開豁，
@a@
遠矚林園。
it would be possible
[]
for someone sitting here
亦有眾生在此堂中，
to see only things outside
@a@
without seeing the Buddha
不見如來，
(within).‘ {29}
[]
@a@
見堂外者。

Ānanda replied:
阿難答言：世尊！
‘One cannot see the grove and stream outside
@a@
without seeing the Buddha
在堂不見如來，
(here).’
[]
@a@
能見林泉，無有是處。

(The Buddha said:)
[]
‘Āṇanda,
阿難！
it is the
[]
same with you;
汝亦如是。
(if
[]
your mind
汝之心靈
is not deluded), it will be
[]
clear about all this.
一切明了。
However,
[]
if your knowing mind
若汝現前所明了心
was really in your body,
實在身內，
you should first
爾時先合
be clear about
了知
everything inside it.
內身。
You should,
頗有眾生，
therefore,
[]
see everything in your body
先見身中，
before seeing things outside it;
後觀外物，
even if you cannot see
縱不能見
your heart, liver, spleen, and stomach,
心肝脾胃，
at least you should be
[]
clear about your growing nails and hair,
爪生髮長，
about that which
[]
moves along your nerves
筋轉
and the
[]
pulsing of your veins.
脈搖，
Why are you
誠合明了，
not clear about all this?
如何不知。
If you do not
必不
see things within,
內知，
how can you see
云何
those outside?
知外。
Therefore,
是故應知，
your contention that
汝言
your knowing mind is
覺了能知之心，
inside your body
住在身內，
is groundless.’
無有是處。

Ānanda bowed and said:
阿難稽首而白佛言：
‘After hearing
我聞
the Buddha’s Dharma-voice,
如來如是法音，
I now understand that
悟知
my mind is
我心
really outside my body.
實居身外。
[]
所以者何？
For instance a lamp
譬如燈光
[]
然於室中，
should light up everything in a room
是燈必能先照室內，
before the courtyard outside through the open door.
從其室門，後及庭際。
If I do not see what is in my body
一切眾生，不見身中，
but see things outside it,
獨見身外。
this is like
亦如
a lamp
燈光，
placed outside a room
居在室外，
which cannot
不能
light what is in it.
照室。
This being so clear that
是義必明，
there can be no doubt,
將無所惑。
am I still wrong about
@a@
what the Buddha means?’
同佛了義，
@a@
得無妄耶。

The Buddha said:
佛告阿難：
‘All the bhikṣus
是諸比丘，
followed me
適來從我
to Śrāvastī
室羅筏城，
to beg for food
循乞摶食，
and have now
[]
returned to
歸
Jetavana park.
祇陀林。
I have taken my meal
我已宿齋。
but as
汝觀比丘，
one bhikṣu is still eating,
一人食時，
is the
[]
whole community
諸人
well-fed?’
飽不？

Ānanda replied:
阿難答言：
‘No,
不也，
World Honoured One,
世尊。
[]
何以故？
though they are arhats,
是諸比丘，雖阿羅漢，
they have
[]
not the same body
軀命不同。
or life span {30} then
[]
how can
云何
one by eating
一人
cause all the others
能令眾
to satisfy their hunger?’
飽？

The Buddha said:
佛告阿難：
‘If your knowing mind
若汝覺了知見之心，
is outside your body,
實在身外，身心相外，
the two are separate.
自不相干。
Thus when
[]
your mind
則心
knows something,
所知，
your body
身
should
[]
not feel it
不能覺。
and when
[]
your body feels something,
覺在身際，
your mind
心
should not be aware of it.
不能知。
Now as I show you
我今示汝
my hand,
兜羅綿手，
when your eyes see it,
汝眼見時，
does
[]
your mind discern it?’
心分別不？

Ānanda replied:
阿難答言：
‘Yes,
如是，
World Honoured One,
世尊。
my mind discerns it.’
[]

The Buddha said:
佛告阿難：
‘If so,
若相知者，
how can
云何
your mind be
[]
outside
在外？
your body?
[]
Therefore,
是故應知，
your contention
汝言
that your
[]
knowing and discerning
覺了能知
mind
之心，
is outside your body
住在身外，
is groundless.’
無有是處。

Ānanda said:
阿難白佛言：
‘World Honoured One,
世尊！
as you have said,
如佛所言，
if my mind
[]
does not see
不見
what is in
內故，
my body, it is
[]
not within it,
不居身內。
and if
[]
my body and mind
身心
know each other,
相知，
they are
[]
not separate
不相離故，
and my mind is, therefore,
[]
not outside my body.
不在身外。
Now after
[]
thinking about this,
我今思惟，
I know where my mind is.
知在一處。

The Buddha asked:
佛言：
‘Where is it?’
處今何在？

Ānanda replied:
阿難言：
‘Since
[]
my knowing mind
此了知心，
does not
既不
see what is in
知內，
my body but
[]
can see things outside,
而能見外。
I think it is
如我思忖，
hidden in
潛伏
my sense organ.
根裏。
For instance,
猶如
if one
有人，
covers one’s eyes
@a@
with
[]
a crystal bowl,
取琉璃碗，
@a@
合其兩眼。
the latter
雖有物合，
does not
而不
obstruct this sense organ
留礙。
which simply
[]
follows the (faculty of) seeing
彼根隨見，
to distinguish all things seen.
隨即分別。
Thus
然
if my knowing mind
我覺了能知之心，
does not see what is in
不見內者，
(my body), it is
[]
because
為
it is
[]
in the sense organ,
在根故。
and if it
[]
sees clearly
分明矚
what is outside
外，
without being
無
obstructed,
障礙者，
it is because it is
[]
hidden
潛
in that organ.‘ {31}
根內故。

The Buddha asked:
佛告阿難：
‘As you just said,
如汝所言，
the mind is hidden
潛根內者，
in the same way that
猶如
the eyes are covered by
[]
the crystal bowl:
琉璃。
now when one so
彼人當
covers them
以琉璃籠眼，
and sees
當見
the mountain
山
and
[]
river,
河，
does one also
[]
see the bowl?’
見琉璃不？

Ānanda replied:
[]
‘Yes, World Honoured One,
如是，世尊！
one
是人
[]
當以琉璃籠眼，
also sees the bowl.’
實見琉璃。

The Buddha said:
佛告阿難：
‘If your mind is like
汝心若同
the crystal bowl,
琉璃合者。
when you see
當見
the mountain
山
and river,
河，
why
何
do you
[]
not
不
see your own eyes?
見眼？
If you do,
若見眼者，
they should be outside
眼即同境，
and
[]
should not follow your faculty of seeing.
不得成隨。
If they cannot be seen,
若不能見，
how can you say that
云何說言
this knowing mind is
此了知心，
hidden in the sense organ,
潛在根內，
like the (eyes)
如
covered by the crystal bowl?
琉璃合。
Therefore,
是故應知，
your contention that
汝言
the knowing mind
覺了能知之心，
is hidden
潛伏
in the sense organ
根裏，
[]
如琉璃合，
is groundless.’
無有是處。

Ānanda asked:
阿難白佛言：
‘World Honoured One, I now think of
世尊！我今又作如是思惟。
the bowels concealed in the body
是眾生身，腑藏在中，
and of
[]
the apertures on its surface.
竅穴居外。
Therefore,
[]
where there is
有
concealment
藏
there is darkness
則暗，
and
[]
where there are openings
有竅
there is light.
則明。
As I am now
今我
before the Buddha,
對佛，
I open my eyes
開眼
and see clearly
見明，
and this
[]
is called
名為
outward seeing,
見外。
and when
[]
I close them,
閉眼
I see (only) darkness
見暗，
and this
[]
is called
名為
inward seeing.
見內。
What does the Buddha
是義云何？
think of this?’
[]

The Buddha said:
佛告阿難：
‘When you close your eyes
汝當閉眼
and see darkness,
見暗之時，
is this darkness
此暗境界，
opposite to your eyes
為與眼對，
or not?
為不對眼？
If it is,
若與眼對，
it is
[]
in front of them,
暗在眼前，
then
[]
how can this
云何
be inward seeing?
成內？
Even if there is really
若成
such inward seeing,
內者，
when you sit
居暗
in a dark room
室中，
without
無
the light of
[]
the sun, moon or a lamp,
日月燈，
this darkness
此室暗中，
should also be
皆
in your bowels.
汝焦腑。
If it is not opposite
若不對者，
to {32} your eyes,
[]
how can there be
云何
any seeing?
成見？
Now let us forget (your so-called)
若離
outward seeing
外見，
and assume that
[]
there is inward seeing,
內對所成。
then
[]
when you close your eyes
合眼
and see only darkness,
見暗，
which you call seeing
名為
what is in your body,
身中。
why when you open them
開眼
and see clearly,
見明，
do you not
何不
see your face?
見面？
If you do not,
若不見面，
there is
[]
no such inward seeing.
內對不成。
Now
[]
assuming that you can see your face,
見面若成，
your knowing mind
此了知心，
and organ of sight
及與眼根，
should be in the air,
乃在虛空，
and then
[]
how can there be
何成
inward seeing?
在內？
If they were
若在
in the air,
虛空，
they should not belong
自非
to your body,
汝體。
and the Buddha
即應如來，
who now sees
今見
your face,
汝面，
should be your body as well.
亦是汝身。
Thus
[]
when your eyes
汝眼
see something,
已知，
your body
身合
should have no feeling.
非覺。
If you insist
必汝執言，
that both body and mind
身眼兩覺，
have separate feelings,
應有二知，
there should be two separate perceptions
[]
and then your body
即汝一身，
should (one day)
[]
become two Buddhas.
應成兩佛。
Therefore,
是故應知，
your contention that
汝言
to see darkness is
見暗名
inward seeing
見內者，
is groundless.’
無有是處。

Ānanda said:
阿難言：
‘I have always
[]
heard the Buddha
我嘗聞佛
when teaching
開示
monks, nuns and male and female devotees
四眾，
say:
[]
“When the mind stirs
由心生故，
all sorts of things are created
種種法生；
and then
由法生故，
all kinds of mind appear.”
種種心生。
I now think
我今思惟，
that the
[]
substance of (my) thinking
即思惟體，
is the nature of mind
實我心性。
which arises
@a@
when
[]
it unites with externals
隨所合處，
@a@
心則隨有。
and which is
亦
neither within
非內
nor without
外
nor in between.’
中間三處。

The Buddha said:
佛告阿難：
‘You have just said that
汝今說言，
because phenomena are created,
由法生故，
all kinds of mind appear
種種心生，
when uniting with them.
隨所合處。
So
[]
[]
心隨有者，
this mind
是心
has no substance
無體，
and
[]
cannot unite with anything.
則無所合。
If that which has no substance
若無有體
can unite with externals,
而能合者，
this is
則
union of the nineteenth realm of sense {33}
十九界因
with the seventh sense datum.
七塵合，
This is sheer nonsense.
是義不然。
If the mind has substance,
若有體者，
when your hand
如汝以手
grasps your body,
自挃其體。
does your mind
汝所知心，
feeling this (touch)
[]
come from within
為復內出，
or without?
為從外入？
If from within,
若復內出，
you should
[]
see what is in your body
還見身中。
and if from without,
若從外來，
you should see your face.’
先合見面。

Ānanda said:
阿難言：
‘It is the eyes
見是
that see
其眼。
and the
[]
mind that knows
心知
is not the eyes:
非眼。
to say that it sees is wrong.’
為見非義。

The Buddha said:
佛言：
‘If the eyes
若眼
can see,
能見，
when you are
汝在
in a room,
室中，
do you see the door (outside)?
門能見不？
Those who are dead
則諸已死，
and still have eyes,
尚有眼存，
should see things.
應皆見物。
If they still see,
若見物者，
how can they be dead?
云何名死？
Ānanda,
阿難！
if your knowing mind
又汝覺了能知之心，
has substance,
若必有體，
is that substance single
為復一體，
or manifold?
為有多體？
As it is in your body,
今在汝身，
does it
[]
spread to every part of it
為復遍體，
or not?
為不遍體？
If it is one substance,
若一體者，
when you grasp a limb,
則汝以手挃一支時，
all four should feel that
四支應覺。
they are grasped;
[]
if so
若咸覺者，
there would
[]
be no grasping
挃應無在。
(of any particular limb).
[]
If there is,
若挃有所，
the contention of
[]
a single substance
則汝一體，
does not hold good.
自不能成。
If it is a manifold substance
若多體者，
there should
[]
be many persons;
則成多人，
then
[]
which substance is yours?
何體為汝？
If it spreads to every part
若遍體者，
of your body, this is the same
[]
as in the previous case
同前所挃。
of grasping.
[]
If it does not spread,
若不遍者，
then when
[]
you touch your head
當汝觸頭，
and
[]
foot at the same time,
亦觸其足，
while
[]
your head feels
頭有所覺，
that it is touched; your
[]
foot should not,
足應無知。
but this is not so.
今汝不然。
Therefore,
是故應知，
your contention that
[]
the mind arises where
@a@
there is
[]
union with externals
隨所合處，
@a@
心則隨有，
is groundless.’
無有是處。

Ānanda said:
阿難白佛言：
‘World Honoured One,
世尊！
I have heard the Buddha
我亦聞佛，
discuss Reality with
@a@
other sons of the King of the {34} Law
與文殊等諸法王子，
@a@
談實相時，
(i.e. Bodhisattvas);
[]
He also said that
世尊亦言，
the mind is
心
neither within
不在內，
nor without.
亦不在外。
I now deduce that
如我思惟，
if the mind is in the body,
[]
it does not see anything within
內無所見，
and if it is outside,
外
they both cease to feel each other.
不相知。
To say that it is within is wrong for
內無知故，
it does not know anything in the body.
在內不成。
To say that it is
[]
without is also faulty
@a@
since
[]
body and mind
身心
can
[]
perceive
相知，
each other.
[]
@a@
在外非義。
As they do so and
今相知故，
since
[]
nothing is seen in
復內無見，
the body, the mind should be
[]
between the two
當在中間。
(i.e. the inside and outside).’
[]

The Buddha said:
佛言：
‘If
[]
your conception
汝言
of a mind
[]
“in between”
中間，
is correct, it
[]
implies a position for it.
中必不迷，非無所在。
Now according
[]
to your inference,
今汝推中，
where is this intermediate position?
中何為在？為復在處？
Do you mean that it is
[]
(in or on) the body?
為當在身？
If it is on the surface of the body,
若在身者，
it cannot be in its center,
在邊非中，
and the conception of
[]
a mind in the center
在中
is no different
同
from that of a mind
[]
in the body
內。
(which was refuted earlier).
[]
(Moreover)
[]
is its position
若在處者，
manifest
為有所表，
or not?
為無所表。
If it is not,
無表
it does not exist.
同無。
If it is,
表則
it is not fixed.
無定。
Why?
何以故？
For instance,
如
if a stake is driven into the ground
人以表，
to mark a center,
表為中時，
when
[]
seen from the east
東看
it is in the west
則西，
and when
[]
seen from the south
南觀
it is in the north.
成北。
As this stake can only
表體
lead to confusion,
既混，
so is (your conception of)
[]
a mind in between
心應
completely chaotic.’
雜亂。

Ānanda said:
阿難言：
‘The intermediate position
@a@
that I mentioned
我所
@a@
說中，
is not these two.
非此二種。
As the World Honoured One
如世尊
has said,
言，
the eyes and form
眼色
are causes
為緣，
from which
[]
sight-perception arises.
生於眼識。
While
[]
the eyes can distinguish,
眼有分別，
form does not
色塵
follow anything
無知。
and perception
識
lies between them;
生其中，
hence the mind arises.‘ {35}
則為心在。

The Buddha said:
佛言：
‘If the mind
汝心若
lies between sense organs and sense data,
在根塵之中，(此之心體，)
does it include both
為復兼二？
or not?
為不兼二？
If it does,
若兼二者，
its substance and what is outside
物體
will be mixed up together,
雜亂。
and since the mind perceives while its objects do not,
物非體知，
two opposites
成敵
will be set up;
兩立，
then how can there be
云何
an intermediate
為中？
(position)?
[]
If it is not inclusive,
兼二不成，
(that is if it is independent of the sense organs and sense data), being
[]
neither the knower
非知
(subject)
[]
nor the known
不知，
(object),
[]
it has no substance;
即無體性，
then
[]
what is this intermediate?
中何為相？
Therefore,
是故應知，
your contention that
[]
it is in between
當在中間，
is groundless.’
無有是處。

Ānanda said: ‘World Honoured One,

If it “is not,”

If it “is”

it cannot be said

無。
That which “is not”

在大眾中，
rose from his seat,

uncovered his

# Origin of Inversion

The Buddha said:
佛告阿難：
‘Since the time without beginning,
@a@
all living beings
一切眾生，
@a@
從無始來，
have given rise to
[]
all sorts of inversion
種種顛倒，
because of
[]
the karmic seed
業種自然，
(of ignorance) which is
[]
like the aksa shrub. {39}
如惡叉聚。

This is why
[]
seekers of the Truth
諸修行人，
fail to realize
不能得成
Supreme Enlightenment
無上菩提，
but
乃至
achieve only
別成
(the states of)
[]
śrāvakas,
聲聞
pratyeka-buddhas,
緣覺，
heretics,
及成外道，
devas
諸天
and demons,
魔王，
[]
及魔眷屬，
solely because they
皆由
do not know
不知
the two basic inversions,
二種根本，
thereby
[]
practising wrongly
錯亂修習。
like those who
猶如

in spite of

the passing of aeons as countless as the dust.
經塵劫，(終不能得。)
What are these
云何
two basic inversions?
二種？
Ānanda,
阿難！
the first is
一者，
@c@
無始
the basic root of birth and death caused,
生死根本。
since the time without beginning,
@c@
by the wrong
(則汝今者，與諸眾生，)
use of a clinging mind
用攀緣心，
which people
[]
mistake for their own nature;
為自者。
and
[]
the second is
二者，
their attachment to causal conditions (which screen)
[]
[]
無始
@d@
菩提涅槃，
the basically bright

essence

of consciousness which is the
[]
fundamentally pure and clean substance
清淨體。
of Nirvanic Enlightenment.
@d@
[]
則汝今者識精元明，
[]
能生諸緣，

Thus

they ignore this
諸眾生，遺
basic brightness

and so
[]
transmigrate

without realizing
而不自覺，
the futility

of their (wrong) practice. {40}

# Actual Inversion
## The Inverted Mind
### Probe into the false mind

‘Ānanda,
阿難！
as you have enquired about
汝今欲知
the Śamatha Gateway
奢摩他路，
through which
[]
to escape from
願出
birth and death,
生死，
I must ask you
今復問汝。
a question.’
[]
The Buddha then
即時如來
held up His golden-hued arm
舉金色臂，
and
[]
bent His fingers,
屈五輪指，
saying: ‘Ānanda,
語阿難言：
do you see this?’
汝今見不？
Ānanda replied: ‘Yes.’
阿難言見。
The Buddha asked:
佛言：
‘What do you see?’
汝何所見？
Ānanda replied:
阿難言：
‘I see the Buddha
我見如來
raise His arm
舉臂
and
[]
bend His fingers,
屈指，
showing a shining fist
為光明拳，
that dazzles my mind and eyes.’
耀我心目。
The Buddha asked:
佛言：
‘How do you see it?’
汝將誰見？
Ānanda replied:
阿難言：
‘I and all those here
我與大眾，
use the eyes to see it.’
同將眼見。
The Buddha asked:
佛告阿難：
‘You say that
汝今答我，
I bend my fingers
如來屈指
to show a shining fist
為光明拳，
that
[]
dazzles
耀
your mind and eyes;
汝心目。
now tell me, as
[]
you see my fist,
汝目可見，
what is that mind
以何為心，
which
[]
perceives
當
its brightness?’
我拳耀？
Ānanda replied:
阿難言：
‘As the Tathāgata
如來現今
asks about the mind
徵心所在。
and since I am
[]
using my own
而我以心
to search for it exhaustively,
推窮尋逐，
I conclude that
[]
that which searches
即能推者，
is my mind.’
我將為心。

### Thinking is unreal

The Buddha said:
佛言：
‘Hey!
咄！
Ānanda,
阿難！
this is not your mind.’
此非汝心。
Ānanda
阿難
stared with astonishment,
矍然，
[]
避座
brought his two palms together,
合掌
rose from his seat
起立
and asked:
白佛：
‘If this is not
此非
my mind,
我心，
what is it?’
當名何等？
The Buddha replied:
佛告
‘Ānanda,
阿難：
this is your false thinking which
[]
arises from external objects,
此是前塵
deludes your true nature
虛妄相想，
and
[]
deceives you into mistaking,
惑汝真性。
since the time without beginning,
由汝無始至於今生，
a thief for your own son,
認賊為子，
thereby
[]
losing {41}
失
(sight of) that which is
[]
basically permanent;
汝元常，
hence
故
the round of
[]
birth and death.’
受輪轉。

### The sixth consciousness is empty

Ānanda said:
阿難白佛言：
[]
世尊！
‘I am
我
the Buddha’s beloved

弟，
whose mind

承事
@a@
諸佛及善知識，
[]
發大勇猛，
If I am determined
[]
to do all
行諸一切
difficult Dharma duties,
難行法事，
it is because
[]
I use this mind,
皆用此心。
and even if I now
縱令
slander the Dharma,
謗法，
causing my excellent qualities
@b@
to weaken for ever,
永退
@b@
善根，
it is also because of
亦因
this mind.
此心。
If it
若此
was not mind,
發明不是心者，
I would
我乃
have no mind
無心，
and would be like
同諸
the earth or a log
土木，
for nothing exists beyond {42}
@c@
what I feel and know.
離此覺知，
@c@
更無所有。
Why does
云何
the Buddha
如來
now say that
說
it is not mind?
此非心？
This frightens me
我實驚怖。
and
[]
also this assembly
兼此大眾，
and
[]
not one of us
無不
here can avoid being
[]
doubtful and suspicious
疑惑。
about it.
[]
Will you be so compassionate
惟垂大悲，
as to enlighten us?’
開示未悟。

the Patient Endurance of the Uncreate
無生法忍。
(Anutpattika-dharma-kṣānti),
[]
@a@
於師子座，
held out His hand to

all causes and effects
一切因果，
including (all things from)

the world to its dust,

take shape (solely) because of the mind.
因心成體。
Ānanda,

觀，
[]
所了知性，
as your true mind,
必為心者。
it should
此心即應
have its own nature,
@a@
independent of all
離諸一切
(sense data such as)
[]
form,
色
smell,
香
taste
味
and
[]
touch.
觸
[]
諸塵事業，
@a@
別有全性。
As you now
如汝今者
listen to my
承聽我
sermon on
[]
the Dharma,
法，
you differentiate
@b@
because you hear my voice.’
此則因聲
@b@
而有分別。

### The seventh consciousness is unreal

‘Even if you
縱
(succeed in)
[]
putting an end to all
滅一切
seeing,
見
hearing,
聞
feeling and
覺
knowing,
知，
and so
[]
preserve inner quiet,
內守幽閑，
the shadow of (your) differentiation of things
@a@
(dharmā)
[]
still {43} remains.
猶為法塵
@a@
分別影事。
I do not
我非
want you to hold
敕汝，
that
[]
this is not mind,
執為非心。
but you should examine it
但汝於心，
carefully and minutely:
微細揣摩。
@b@
若離前塵
that which continues to
[]
possess discerning nature
有分別性，
even in the absence of sense data
@b@
is really your mind;
即真汝心。
(on the other hand)
[]
if this discerning nature
若分別性，
ceases with sense data,
離塵無體，
this is merely
斯則
the shadow of (your)
[]
differentiation of them,
前塵分別影事。
for they are not permanent
塵非常住，
and
[]
when they cease to exist,
若變滅時，
so does
[]
this (so-called) mind,
此心則
like
同
the
[]
hair of a tortoise
龜毛
and the
[]
horns of a hare.
兔角，
If your Dharmakāya
則汝法身
can so
[]
easily cease to be,
同於斷滅，
who will
其誰
then
[]
practise
修
and
[]
realize
證
the Patient Endurance of the Uncreate?’
無生法忍。

After hearing this,
即時
Ānanda and all those present
阿難與諸大眾，
were completely bewildered. {44}
默然自失。

### Refuting all inversion

The Buddha said:
佛告阿難：
‘Practising students,
世間一切諸修學人，
even after
現前
they have
[]
realized
雖成
the nine successive states of dhyāna,
九次第定，
still cannot
不得
step out of the stream of transmigration
漏盡
and so fail to
[]
become
成
Arhats,
阿羅漢，
because
皆由
they cling to this
執此
samsaric false thinking
生死妄想，
which they
[]
mistake for
誤為
Reality.
真實。
This is why,
是故
though you have
汝今雖得
heard much
多聞，
(of my Dharma), you have
[]
failed to win
不成
the holy fruit.
聖果。

## The Inverted Perception

After hearing this, Ānanda,
阿難聞已，
in bitter tears,
重復悲淚，
prostrated himself with his
[]
head, knees and elbows on the ground,
五體投地，
knelt and
長跪
brought his two palms together,
合掌，
saying:
而白佛言：
‘After I left home
@a@
to follow the Buddha,
自我從佛，
@a@
發心出家，
I merely
[]
relied on His
恃佛
transcendental power
威神。
and
[]
always thought that
常自思惟，
I could
[]
dispense with practice
無勞我修，
since He would
將謂如來
bestow samādhi
惠我三昧。
upon me.
[]
I did not know
不知
that He could
[]
not be my substitute
身心本不相代，
and so
[]
lost (sight of)
失我
my fundamental Mind.
本心。
This is why,
[]
though
雖
I joined the Order,
身出家，
my mind
心
was unable to
不
enter the Tao.
入道。
I was like
譬如
a destitute son
窮子，
running away from his father.
捨父逃逝。
I only realize now that,
今日乃知，
in spite of
雖
much
有多
listening
聞，
(to the Dharma),
[]
if I do not practise it,
若不修行，
I shall come to nothing as if I
[]
had not heard it,
與不聞等。
like a man
如人
who cannot satisfy his hunger
@b@
by merely
[]
speaking of food.
說食，
@b@
終不能飽。
World Honoured One,
世尊！
I am
我等今者，
caught by the two hindrances
二障所纏。
because
良由
I do not know the
不知
(real)
[]
nature of the still and permanent Mind.
寂常心性。
May the Tathāgata be compassionate enough
惟願如來，哀愍
to fully reveal to me {45}
窮露，
that wondrous Bright Mind
發妙明心，
and so
[]
open my Tao eye.
開我道眼。

### A bright Light to reveal the One Reality

Thereupon
即時
the Tathāgata,
如來，
from the sauvastika on His chest,
從胸卍字
sent out
涌出
a radiant multi-coloured
@a@
precious Light
寶光。
@a@
其光晃昱，有百千色。
which
[]
@b@
十方微塵，
illuminated the Buddha lands
普佛世界，
in the ten directions
一時周遍。
as countless as the dust
@b@
and which,
[]
after shining on
遍灌十方所有寶剎
the heads of all Buddhas
諸如來頂。
everywhere,
[]
veered to Ānanda
旋至阿難，
and the assembly.
及諸大眾。
The Buddha then
[]
said to Ānanda:
告阿難言：
‘I now
吾今為汝
hoist
建
the banner of Great Dharma
大法幢。
so that
亦令
you and
[]
all living beings in the ten directions
十方一切眾生，
can realize
獲
the pure and bright Mind
@a@
of your
[]
profound and subtle Nature
妙微密，
@a@
性淨明心，
and so
[]
win
得
the Eye that is pure and clear.’
清淨眼。


### Returning perception to Mind

‘Ānanda,
阿難！
a moment ago
[]
you said that
汝先答我
you saw
見
my shining {46} fist;
光明拳。
tell me,
[]
how did
@a@
its brightness come about,
此拳光明，
@a@k
因何所有？
what caused it
云何
to take the form
成
of a fist
拳？
and
[]
with what did you see it?’
汝將誰見？

Ānanda replied:
阿難言：
‘The Buddha’s
由佛
golden-hued body
全體， 閻浮檀金，
is like a precious hill
赩如寶山，
and
[]
manifests
@a@
(the state of)
[]
purity and cleanness,
清淨
@a@
所生，
so that the fist shone.
故有光明。
It was really
我實
my eyes
眼觀，
that saw Him
[]
bend the fingers
五輪指端，
and
[]
form a fist
屈握示人，
which was shown
故有拳相。
to all of us.’
[]

The Buddha said:
佛告阿難：
如來今日
[]
‘In truth
實言告汝。
wise people
諸有智者，
should be awakened
@a@
by examples and analogies.
要以譬喻
@a@
而得開悟。
Ānanda,
阿難！
[]
譬如我拳，
if I had no hand
若無我手，
I would have no fist
不成我拳。
and
[]
if you had no eyes,
若無汝眼，
you would have
[]
no (faculty of) seeing.
不成汝見。
Is there
[]
any connection between
@a@
your organ of sight
以汝眼根，
and my fist?’
例我拳理，
@a@
其義均不？

Ānanda replied:
阿難言：
‘Yes, World Honoured One.
唯然世尊。
If I had no eyes,
既無我眼，
I would have no (faculty of) seeing;
不成我見。
so there is
[]
an analogy between
@a@
my organ of sight
以我眼根，
and the Buddha’s fist.’
例如來拳，
@a@
事義相類。

The Buddha said:
佛告阿難：
‘Your reasoning
汝言相類，
is incorrect.
是義不然。
[]
何以故？
For instance,
如
a handless man
無手人，
has no fist,
拳畢竟滅。
but
[]
a man without eyes
彼無眼者，
still has his (faculty of) seeing.
非見全無。
[]
所以者何？
When you meet a blind man
汝試於途，
and
[]
ask him
詢問盲人，
what he sees,
汝何所見？
he will
彼諸盲人，
tell you
必來答汝，
there is
[]
@a@
我今眼前，唯見黑暗，
nothing but
更無他矚。
darkness in front
@a@
of him.
[]
Therefore,
以是義觀，
though
[]
things may be screened
前塵自暗，
from view
[]
the (faculty of)
[]
seeing continues.’
見何虧損？

Ānanda said:
阿難言：
‘If a blind man
諸盲眼前，
sees nothing but
唯睹
darkness
黑暗，
before him,
[]
how can
云何
this be called
成
seeing?’
見？

The Buddha asked:
佛告阿難：
‘Is there any difference between
@a@
the darkness seen by a blind man
諸盲無眼，唯觀黑暗，
in front of him
[]
and
與
that seen by
[]
a man who is not blind
有眼人，
when he is
[]
in a dark room?’
處於暗室，
@a@
二黑有別，為無有別？

(Ānanda replied):
[]
‘World Honoured One,
@a@
there is
[]
no difference.‘ {47}
如是
@a@
世尊。
[]
此暗中人，
[]
與彼群盲，
[]
二黑校量，
[]
曾無有異。
The Buddha said:
[]
‘Ānanda,
阿難！
when a blind man
若無眼人，
who used to
[]
see only darkness
全見前黑，
suddenly
忽
recovers
得
his sight
眼光，
and 還於前塵，
[]
sees every thing clearly,
見種種色，
if you
[]
say
名
that it is his
[]
eyes
眼
which see,
見者。
then when a man
[]
who saw darkness
@a@
in a dark room
彼暗中人，
@a@
全見前黑，
suddenly
忽
lights a lamp
獲燈光，
which enables him to
(亦於前塵，)
see what is there,
見種種色，
you should say that
[]
it is the
應名
lamp that sees.
燈見。
If a lamp
若燈
can see
見者，
things, it should
[]
have (the faculty of) seeing
燈能有見，
and should
[]
not be called
自不名
a lamp;
燈。
if it really sees,
又則燈觀，
it has no relation to you.
何關汝事。
Therefore,
是故
you should know that
當知，
while
[]
the lamp can
燈能
reveal form,
顯色。
[]
如是見者，
seeing comes
[]
from the eyes
是眼
but
[]
not from the lamp.
非燈。
Likewise, while
[]
your eyes
眼能
can reveal form,
顯色，
the nature of seeing
如是見性，
comes
[]
from the mind
是心
but
[]
not from the eyes.’
非眼。

## Inverted Men

Although Ānanda
阿難雖復
and the assembly
@a@
had heard these words,
得聞是言，
@a@
與諸大眾，
they
[]
remained speechless.
口已默然，
As they did
[]
not awaken to the Teaching,
心未開悟。
[]
猶冀如來，
[]
慈音宣示，
they
[]
brought their palms together
合掌清心，
and
[]
waited for
佇
the Buddha’s
佛
further instruction
悲誨。
with their minds set on {48} hearing it.
[]

### The worlding's inverted views

The Buddha then
爾時世尊，
held up
舒
His shining hand,
兜羅綿網相光手，
straightened
開
His fingers
五輪指，
to give (further) instruction
[]
to
誨敕
Ānanda and the assembly
阿難，及諸大眾。
and asked:
[]
‘After I attained Enlightenment
我初成道，
(Bodhi),
[]
I went to Mṛgadāva park
於鹿園中，
where
[]
I told Ājnāta-kauṇḍinya
為阿若多
and
[]
his group of five bhikṣus
五比丘等，
as well as
[]
you monks, nuns and devotees,
及汝四眾言。
that
[]
all living beings
一切眾生，
failed to realize
不成
Enlightenment
菩提，
and became Arhats
及阿羅漢，
because
皆由
they were
[]
misled by foreign dust
客塵煩惱所誤。
which created delusion and distress (by entering their minds).
[]
What at that time
汝等當時，
caused you to awaken
因何開悟，
so that you can
[]
now win
今成
the holy fruit?’
聖果。

Ājñāta-kauṇḍinya then
時憍陳那，
rose from his seat
起立
and
[]
replied to the Buddha:
白佛：
‘I am now a senior
我今長老，
in the assembly
於大眾中，
in which I am the only one who
[]
has acquired
獨得
the art of interpreting
解名。
because
因
I had awakened to
悟
(the meaning of) the expression
[]
“foreign dust,”
客塵二字
so that
[]
I won the (holy) fruit.
成果。
World Honoured One,
世尊！
(foreign dust)
[]
is like
譬如
a guest
行客，
who
[]
stops at an inn
投寄旅亭，
where
[]
he passes the night
或宿
or eats something
或食，
and then
(食宿事畢，)
packs and
俶裝
continues his journey
前途，
because
[]
he cannot stay longer.
不遑安住。
As to
[]
the host of the inn,
若實主人，
he has nowhere to go.
自無攸往。
My deduction is that
如是思惟，
one who does not stay
不住
is a guest
名客，
and
[]
one who stays
住
is a host.
名主人，
Consequently,
[]
a thing is “foreign”
@a@
when it does not stay.
以不住者，
@a@
名為客義。
Again,
又
when the sun rises
@a@
in a clear sky
如新霽。
@a@
清暘升天，
and
[]
its light
光
enters
入
(the house)
[]
through an opening,
隙中，
the dust is seen to {49} dance
@a@
in the ray of light
發明空中
@a@
諸有塵相。塵質搖動，
whereas
[]
the empty space
虛空
does
[]
not move.
寂然。
I deduce that
如是思惟，
that which is still
澄寂
is the void
名空，
and
[]
that which moves
搖動
is the dust.
名塵。
Consequently,
[]
a thing is “dust”
@a@
when it moves.’
以搖動者，
@a@
名為塵義。

The Buddha said:
佛言：
‘Correct.’
如是。

### The Hinayanist’s inverted views

The Buddha
即時如來，
then
於大眾中，
bent,
屈五輪指，
straightened
屈已復開，
and
[]
rebent his fingers
開已又屈。
and
[]
asked Ānanda:
謂阿難言：
‘What did you see?’
汝今何見。
Ānanda replied:
阿難言：
‘I saw
我見
the Buddha
如來
@a@
百寶輪掌，
open and close
眾中開合。
His fist.’
@a@
The Buddha asked:
佛告阿難：
‘You say that
[]
you saw
汝見
my fist
我手，
open and close;
眾中開合。
was
為
it my fist
是我手，
[]
有開有合？
or
為復
your seeing
汝見，
that opened and closed?’
有開有合？
Ānanda replied:
阿難言：
‘As the Buddha’s fist
世尊寶手，
opened and closed,
眾中開合。
I saw
我見
it
如來手自開合。
and
[]
not the nature of my seeing
非我見性
did so by itself.’
(有開有合。)
The Buddha asked:
佛言：
‘Which one moved
誰動
and
[]
which was still?’
誰靜。
Ānanda replied:
阿難言：
‘The Buddha’s hand
佛手
was not still;
不住。
as to
而
the nature of my seeing
我見性，
which was
[]
already beyond
尚無
the state of stillness,
有靜，
it could not move.’
誰為無住。

The Buddha said:
佛言：
‘Correct.’
如是。

Thereupon the Buddha
如來於是
sent out from His palm
從輪掌中，
a radiant ray of light to Ānanda’s right,
飛一寶光，在阿難右。
and
[]
the disciple
即時阿難，
turned to look at it.
迴首右盼。
Then He
[]
sent out another ray
又放一光，
to Ānanda’s left
在阿難左，
and
[]
the disciple
阿難
turned to look at it.
又則迴首左盼。
The Buddha then asked:
佛告阿難：
‘Why did your head move?’
汝頭今日，何因搖動？
Ānanda replied:
阿難言：
‘I saw the Buddha
我見如來
send out
出
radiant rays of light
妙寶光，
to my
來我
right and left,
左右，
I turned to look at them
故左右觀，
and so
[]
my head moved.’
頭自搖動。
(The Buddha‘ said:)
(阿難！)
‘As you turn to the right and left
@a@
to see the Buddha-light,
汝盼佛光，
@a@
左右動頭，
is
為
it your head
汝頭動，
or
為復
your seeing
見
that {50} moves?’
動？
(Ānanda replied:)
[]
‘World Honoured One,
世尊！
it is my head that turns;
我頭自動，
as to my seeing
而我見性
which is
[]
already beyond
尚無
(the state of)
[]
stillness,
有止，
how can it move?’
誰為搖動。

The Buddha said:
佛言：
‘Correct.’
如是。

The Buddha then
於是如來，
declared to the assembly:
普告大眾，
‘So every worldly man
若復眾生，
knows that
[]
what moves
以搖動者
is dust,
名之為塵，
and that
[]
he who does not stay
以不住者
is a guest.
名之為客。
You have seen
汝觀
Ānanda
阿難
whose head moved of itself
頭自動搖，
whereas
[]
his seeing
見
was unmoved.
無所動。
You have also seen
又汝觀
my fist
我手
which opened and closed of itself
自開合，
whereas
[]
his seeing
見
neither expanded
無舒
nor contracted.
卷。
Why do
云何
you still
汝今
regard the moving as
以動為
your body
身，
and
以動為
surroundings,
境？
and so,
[]
from beginning to end,
從始洎終，
allow your
[]
thoughts to rise and fall
念念生滅，
without interruption, thereby
[]
losing
遺失
(sight of) your
[]
true nature
真性，
and indulging
[]
in backward actions?
顛倒行事。
By missing the (True)
@a@
Mind of your nature
性心
@a@
失真，
and by
[]
mistaking (illusory) objects
認物
for your Selves,
為己。
you allow yourselves to be caught
[]
in the wheel (of saṃsāra)
輪迴是中，
thereby
[]
forcing yourselves
自取
to pass through
[]
transmigrations. {51}
流轉。’

{V2}

### The heretics’ inverted view of annihilation

After Ānanda
爾時阿難，
and the whole assembly
及諸大眾，
had heard
聞
the Buddha’s words,
佛示誨，
their bodies and minds
身心
became
[]
calm and composed.
泰然。
They thought
[]
that,
念
since the time without beginning,
無始來，
they had lost
失卻
(sight of)
[]
their own minds
本心，
by wrongly clinging to the shadows
@a@
of their differentiated causal conditions
妄認緣塵，
@a@
分別影事。
and that they had
[]
only now
今日
awakened to all this,
開悟，
like a (hungry) baby
如失乳兒，
who had not suckled for some time,
[]
suddenly saw
忽遇
its loving mother.
慈母。
They brought their palms together
合掌
to thank the Buddha
禮佛，
and
[]
wished to hear
願聞
His teaching
如來，顯出(身心，)
on the dual states
@a@
of reality and unreality,
真妄
existence and non-existence
虛實，
and
(現前)
mortality and immortality
生滅與不生滅，
of body and mind.
[]
@a@
二發明性。

King Prasenajit
時波斯匿王，
then
[]
rose
起立
and
[]
said to the Buddha:
白佛：
‘Before I
我昔未
received
承
the Buddha’s
諸佛
instruction,
誨敕。
I met
見
(Krakuda) Kātyāyana
迦旃延、
and
[]
(Sañjaya) Vairātīputra
毗羅胝子。
who
[]
both said that
咸言
when the body died,
此身死後
its annihilation
斷滅，
was called Nirvāṇa.
名為涅槃。
Although I
我雖
have now
[]
met the Buddha,
值佛，
I am
[]
still not clear
今猶狐疑。
about this.
[]
All those here who are still
@a@
in the stream of transmigration
@b@
wish to know
@c@
how to realize that mind
云何發揮
and prove that
證知此心，
it is beyond birth and death.’
不生滅地。
@a@
今此大眾，
@b@
諸有漏者，
@c@
咸皆願聞。

The Buddha
佛
said to
告
King Prasenajit:
[]
‘Great King,
大王：
[]
汝身現在，
I now ask
今復問汝，
you about
[]
your body of flesh and blood:
汝此肉身，
is it {52} permanent
@a@
and
[]
indestructible like a diamond,
為同金剛，
@a@
常住不朽？
or
為復
does it
[]
change and decay?’
變壞？

(The king replied:)
(世尊！)
‘My body
我今此身，
will decay and
[]
finally be destroyed.’
終從變滅。

The Buddha asked:
佛言：
‘Great King,
大王，
you have not yet died,
汝未曾滅，
how do you know
云何知
that your body will be
[]
destroyed?’
滅？

The king replied:
[]
‘World Honoured One,
世尊！
though my impermanent,
我此無常
changing and decaying body
變壞之身，
is not yet dead,
雖未曾滅，
I observe that
我觀現前，
it changes and decays
念念遷謝，
without a moment’s pause
新新不住。
and
[]
is bound to “go out”
@a@
like a fire
如火成灰，
@a@
漸漸銷殞。
that
[]
gradually burns out
殞亡不息，
[]
決知此身，
and will
[]
be reduced to naught.’
當從滅盡。

The Buddha asked:
佛言：
‘Yes,
如是，
Great King,
大王，
you are old now
汝今生齡，
[]
已從衰老，
but
[]
how do you look
顏貌
compared
何如
to when
[]
you were a child?’
童子之時。

The king replied:
[]
‘World Honoured One,
世尊！
when I was a child,
我昔孩孺，
my skin glowed
膚腠潤澤。
and
[]
when I grew up,
年至長成，
I was full of vigour,
血氣充滿。
but now I age
而今頹齡，
and weaken,
迫於衰耄，
I grow thin
形色枯悴，
and my
[]
spirits are dull,
精神昏昧，
my hair is white
髮白
and my
[]
face wrinkled
面皺，
so that I know I shall
[]
not live
逮將
much longer;
不久，
there is
[]
no comparison
如何見比
between now and when I was
[]
full of vitality.’
充盛之時。

The Buddha said:
佛言：
‘Great King,
大王，
your appearance
汝之形容，
should not decline.’
應不頓朽。

The king replied:
王言：
‘World Honoured One,
世尊！
it has been
[]
changing
變化
all the time
[]
too imperceptibly
密移，
for me to notice it.
我誠不覺。
With the
[]
constant change of seasons,
寒暑遷流，
I have become
漸至
what I am now.
於此。
Why?
何以故？
Because when I
[]
was twenty,
我年二十，
though still young,
雖號年少，
I already looked
顏貌已
older than when I was ten,
老初十歲時。
while at thirty
三十之年，
I was older still.
又衰二十。
As I am now sixty-two,
於今六十又過於二，
I am older than
[]
at fifty
觀五十時，
when I was stronger.
宛然強壯。
World Honoured One,
世尊！
I notice {53}
我見
this imperceptible change
密移，
[]
雖此殂落。其間流易，
in every decade,
且限十年。
but when I
若復令我
look into it closely,
微細思惟，
(I see that)
[]
it has occurred
其變
not only
寧唯一紀二紀，
yearly,
實為年變。
monthly and daily,
@a@
[]
豈唯年變，
@a@
亦兼月化。
@a@
何直月化，
@a@
兼又日遷。
but
沈思諦觀，
in each moment of thought.
剎那剎那，念念之間，
[]
不得停住。
That is why I
[]
know that
故知
my body
我身，
is destined to
終從
final destruction.’
變滅。

The Buddha said:
佛告大王：
‘Great King,
[]
you observe
汝見
this ceaseless change
變化，遷改不停，
and
[]
know that
悟知
you will die,
汝滅。
but
[]
do you know
@a@
that
[]
when you do,
亦於滅時，
there is that which is
[]
@a@
汝知
in your body
身中，
and does not die?’
有不滅耶？

The king
波斯匿王
brought his two palms together
合掌
and said:
白佛：
‘I really
我實
do not know.’
不知。

The Buddha continued:
佛言：
‘I will now show you
我今示汝
the (self-)
[]
nature which is beyond birth and death.
不生滅性。
Great King,
大王，
how old were you
汝年幾時，
when you first
[]
saw the Ganges?’
見恒河水？

The King replied:
王言：
‘When I was three
我生三歲，
my mother took me
慈母攜我，
to worship the deva Jīva.
謁耆婆天，
As we crossed
經過
the river,
此流，
I knew
爾時即知
it was the Ganges.’
是恒河水。

The Buddha asked:
佛言：
‘Great King,
大王，
as you just said,
如汝所說，
you were
[]
older at twenty than at ten,
二十之時，衰於十歲，
and until
乃至
you were sixty,
六十，
as days, months and years
日月歲時，
succeeded one another, your (body)
[]
changed in every moment of thought.
念念遷變。
When you saw the Ganges
@a@
at three,
則汝三歲
@a@
見此河時，
was its water
@a@
(the same as it was) when
[]
you were thirteen?’
至年十三，
@a@
其水云何？

The king replied:
王言：
‘It was the same when I was three
如三歲時，宛然無異。
and thirteen, and
[]
still is now that
乃至於今，
I am sixty-two.’
年六十二，
[]
亦無有異。

The Buddha said:
佛言：
‘As you
[]
now notice
汝今自傷
your
[]
white hair
髮白
and
[]
wrinkled face,
面皺，
there must be many more
[]
wrinkles than
其面必定
when you were a child.
皺於童年。
Today when you
則汝今時，
see the Ganges,
觀此恒河，
do you notice that
[]
your seeing
@a@
is “old”
@b@
now while it was “young” then?‘ {54}
與昔童時，
@a@
觀河之見，
@b@
有童耄不。

The king replied:
王言：
‘It has
[]
always been the same,
不也，
World Honoured One.’
世尊！

The Buddha said:
佛言：
‘Great King,
大王，
though your face is wrinkled,
汝面雖皺，
the nature of this
@a@
essence of your seeing
而此見精，
is not.
[]
@a@
性未曾皺。
Therefore, that which is
[]
wrinkled
皺者
changes
為變，
and that which is
[]
free from wrinkles
不皺
is unchanging.
非變。
The changing is
變者
subject to destruction
受滅。
whereas
[]
the unchanging
彼不變者，
fundamentally is beyond
元無
birth and death;
生滅。
how can it be
云何於中，
subject to your
受汝
birth and death?
生死？
Why do you bring out
而猶引彼
Maskari, Gośāliputra’s
末伽黎等，
(wrong) teaching on
[]
total annihilation
@a@
at the end of this life?’
都言此身
@a@
死後全滅。

Upon hearing this,
王聞是言，
the king realized that after death,
信知身後，
there will be (no annihilation but) life again in other transmigrations.
捨生趣生。
He and the whole assembly were happy and enthusiastic at the Teaching
與諸大眾，踊躍歡喜，
which they had never heard before.
得未曾有。

### The inverted behaviour

After hearing this,
[]
Ānanda rose from his seat,
阿難即從座起。
prostrated himself before the Buddha,
禮佛
brought his two palms together
合掌，
and knelt
長跪
saying:
白佛：
‘World Honoured One,
世尊！
if both seeing and hearing {55}
若此見聞，
are beyond birth and death,
必不生滅，
why has
云何
the Buddha
世尊，
said that
名
we have lost
我等輩，遺失
(sight of)
[]
our True Nature
真性，
and so
[]
acted in an inverted manner?
顛倒行事？
Will you be compassionate enough
願興慈悲，
to enlighten us, and so
[]
wash off our defiling dust?’
洗我塵垢。

Thereupon
即時
the Buddha
如來
lowered
垂
His golden-hued arm
金色臂，
with
[]
the fingers pointing downward
輪手下指，
and asked Ānanda:
示阿難言：
‘As you now see
汝今見
my hand,
我母陀羅手，
is it in a correct
為正
or inverted (position)?’
為倒？

Ānanda replied:
阿難言：
‘All worldly men
世間眾生，
regard this as inverted
以此為倒，
but I myself
而我
do not know
不知
which position
[]
is correct
誰正
or inverted.’
誰倒。

The Buddha asked:
佛告阿難：
‘If they hold that
若世間人，
it is inverted,
以此為倒，
which position do they
即世間人，
consider to be upright?’
將何為正？

Ānanda replied:
阿難言：
‘If the Buddha holds up
如來豎臂，
His hand
兜羅綿手，
pointing to the sky,
上指於空，
it will be upright.
則名為正。

The Buddha then
佛即
held up His hand
豎臂，
and said:
告阿難言：
‘If worldly men so discriminate
若此顛倒，
between an upright and inverted hand,
首尾相換。
they will
諸世間人，
in the same way
一倍
differentiate
瞻視。
between your body
則知汝身，
and the Buddha’s
與諸如來
pure and clean Dharmakāya
清淨法身，
and will say that
比類發明。
the Tathāgata’s body
如來之身，
is
名
completely enlightened
正遍知。
whereas
[]
yours is upside down.
汝等之身，號性顛倒。
If you look closely into
隨汝諦觀，
your body
汝身
and
[]
the Buddha’s,
佛身，
where is this
稱顛倒者，
so called
名字何處，
inversion?
號為顛倒？

After hearing this,
於時
Ānanda and the assembly
阿難，與諸大眾，
were bewildered
瞪瞢瞻佛，
and
[]
gazed fixedly
目睛不瞬，
at the Buddha
[]
without knowing
不知
whether their
[]
bodies and minds
身心，
were really inverted.
顛倒所在。

### Delusion and Enlightenment are of the same source

The Buddha
佛
was moved with
興
compassion and,
慈悲，
out of pity for
哀愍
Ānanda and the assembly,
阿難及諸大眾。
said
發
in His voice as steady as
[]
the {56} ocean tide:
海潮音，
[]
遍告同會：
‘Virtuous men,
諸善男子，
I have always declared
我常說言，
that Form and Mind
色心
and all causes
諸緣，
arising therefrom,
[]
all mental conditions and
及心所使，
all causal phenomena
諸所緣法，
are but
唯
manifestations of the mind.
心所現。
Your bodies and minds
汝身汝心，
are just
皆是
appearances within
@a@
the wonderful, bright and pure Profound Mind.
妙明真精妙心中
@a@
所現物。
Why do you
云何汝等，
stray from
遺失
the precious, bright and subtle
本妙，圓妙明心，
nature of fundamentally Enlightened Mind
寶明妙性，
and so
[]
recognize delusion
@a@
within
[]
enlightenment?’
認悟
@a@
中迷？

‘(Mind’s)
[]
dimness creates (dull) emptiness
晦昧為空，
and both,
[]
in the darkness,
空晦暗中，
unite with it to become form.
結暗為色。
The
[]
mingling of form with false thinking
色雜妄想，
causes
想相
the latter to take the shape of {57}
[]
a body,
為身。
stirred by accumulated causes within
聚緣內搖，
and
[]
drawn to externals without.
趣外奔逸。
Such
[]
inner disturbance
昏擾擾相，
is mistaken for the nature of mind,
以為心性。
hence the
[]
false view of a mind
一迷為心，
dwelling in
決定(惑為)
the physical body
色身之內。
and the
[]
failure to realize
不知
that this body
色身，
as well as
[]
external mountains,
外洎山
rivers,
河，
space
虛空
and the
[]
great earth
大地，
are but
咸是
phenomena within
@a@
the wondrous bright True Mind.
妙明真
@a@
心中物。
Like an
譬如
ignorant man who
[]
overlooks on
@a@
the great ocean
澄清百千大海，
@a@
棄之，
but
唯
grasps
認
at a floating bubble
一浮漚體，
and
[]
regards
目為
it as the
[]
whole body
全潮，
of water in its
[]
immense expanse,
窮盡瀛渤。
you are
汝等即是
doubly deluded amongst the deluded.
迷中倍人。
This is
[]
exactly the same
@a@
delusion as when
[]
I hold my hand down;
如我垂手，
@a@
等無差別。
and so the
[]
Tathāgata says
如來說
that you
[]
are
為
the most
[]
pitiable people.’
可憐愍者。

#! Refuting the false perception to eliminate the fourth aggregate and reveal the non-existence of the seventh consciousness {58}

# Wiping Out the Unreal
## The Non-existence of Discriminative Perception
## Ānanda’s wrong view

Ānanda
阿難
was moved
[]
to tears
@a@
by the Buddha’s compassion and profound Teaching,
承佛悲救深誨，
@a@
垂泣
brought his two palms together
叉手，
and said:
而白佛言：
‘After hearing
我雖承
the Buddha’s
佛，
wonderful Dharma,
如是妙音，
I have
[]
realized
悟
that the
[]
wondrous Bright Mind
妙明心，
is fundamentally perfect,
元所圓滿，
so that I always
[]
dwell
常住
in my Mind-ground.
心地。
But if
[]
my awakening
而我悟佛
has been due to the
[]
Buddha’s preaching,
現說法音，
I have (really)
[]
used my causal mind
現以緣心，
to hear it with reverence,
允所瞻仰，
thereby
[]
merely
徒
realizing that mind.
獲此心，
I dare not pretend
未敢認為
that it is
[]
the fundamental Mind-ground.
本元心地。
Will you be compassionate enough
願佛哀愍，
to enlighten me
宣示圓音。
so as
[]
to remove my (remaining) doubts
拔我疑根，
so that I can
[]
return to the Supreme Tao?’
歸無上道。

## Unreality of illusory causes

The Buddha said:
佛告阿難：
‘You are still using
汝等尚以
your clinging mind
緣心
to listen to the Dharma;
聽法，
since, however, this
[]
Dharma is also {59} causal,
此法亦緣，
you fail to realize
非得
the Dharma-nature.
法性。
This is
[]
like
如
a man pointing a finger
人以手，
at the moon to show
指月示人。
it to others
[]
who should follow
彼人
the direction
[]
of the finger
因指，
to look at the moon.
當應看月。
If they
若復
look at the finger
觀指，
and
[]
mistake it for
以為
the moon,
月體，
they lose
此人豈唯亡失
(sight of) both
[]
the moon
月輪，
and the finger.
亦亡其指。
Why?
何以故？
Because
以
the bright moon is actually pointed at;
所標指為明月故。
they both
[]
lose sight of the finger
豈唯亡指，
and
[]
fail to distinguish between
亦復不識
(the states of)
[]
brightness and darkness.
明之與暗。
Why?
何以故？
Because they
[]
mistake the finger
即以指體，
for the bright moon
為月明性。
and are not
[]
clear about
@a@
brightness and darkness.
明暗二性，
@a@
無所了故。

‘Likewise,
汝亦如是，
if you mistake your (intellect which)
若以分別，
hears my preaching voice
我說法音，
for your
為汝心者。
(true mind),
[]
the latter’s discerning nature
@a@
should be independent of
此心自應離
that differentiated voice.
分別音，
@a@
有分別性。
For instance,
譬如
when a traveller
有客，
spends the night
寄宿
at an inn,
旅亭，
he does so for a time
暫止
and then leaves,
便去，
not staying there for ever:
終不常住。
as to the inn-keeper,
而掌亭人，
he has nowhere else to go
都無所去，
for he owns the inn.
名為亭主。
It is the same
此亦如是。
with your mind.
[]

## Falseness of both sense organs and consciousness

‘If it is
若
your True Mind,
真汝心，
it has nowhere to go.
則無所去。
Then
[]
why
云何
in the absence of speech
離聲，
has it no discerning nature
無分別性？
of its own?
[]
This discriminating
@a@
(intellect)
[]
does not arise only
斯則豈唯
when I speak,
聲
@a@
分別心。
but also when
[]
you discern
分別
my appearance;
我容，
it has
[]
no discerning nature
@a@
of its own
[]
when there is no form.
離諸色相，
@a@
無分別性。
(It is not True Mind)
[]
even when you reach the state
如是乃至
in which all discrimination ceases,
分別都無，
a state that is
[]
neither form
非色
nor Voidness,
非空，
which
[]
the heretics
拘舍離等，
call Primordial Darkness. {60}
昧為冥諦。

## All phenomena returnable to causes are unreal

‘If that which has no discerning nature
@a@
of its own ceases to exist in the
[]
absence of

causal conditions,
法緣，
@a@
無分別性。
how can the (so-called)

nature of your mind
則汝心性，
be an (independent) host
@b@
if it disappears when it
[]
returns to its (illusory) causes?’
各有所還，
@b@
云何為主？

# Borrowing The Essence Of Perception To Pick Out Causal Externals

Ānanda asked:
阿難言：
‘If every state of my mind
若我心性，
can be returned to its cause,
各有所還。
why does
@a@
the Buddha speak of
則如來說，
the wondrous

which is

@a@
云何
not returnable to anywhere? {61}
無還？
Will you be compassionate enough
惟垂哀愍，
to enlighten me?’
為我宣說。

## Setting up the essence of perception

The Buddha said:
佛告阿難：
‘As you see me now,
且汝見我，
the essence of your seeing
見精
is originally clear.
明元。
Although it is not
此見雖非
the profound Bright Mind,
妙精明心，
it is
[]
like
如
a second moon
第二月，
but is not
非是
a reflection of the moon
月影。
(in water).
[]
Now listen attentively
汝應諦聽，

今當示汝，
of that which cannot
無所
return anywhere.

why when
[]
the Buddha and I
我與如來，
saw
觀
the palaces of the four heavenly kings
四天王勝藏寶殿，
and
[]
the sun and moon,
居日月宮，
did this seeing

first

penetrate the whole world
遍娑婆國。
and then
[]
return to this vihāra,

## Breaking up the capacity of seeing

The Buddha replied: ‘Ānanda,
佛告阿難：
all things in this world,
一切世間，
whether large or small,
大小
inner or outer,
內外，
as well as in other conditions,
諸所事業，
are external;
各屬前塵，
you should not say that
不應說言，
your seeing
見有
expands and contracts.
舒縮。
Take
譬如
for instance
[]
a square box
方器，
the inside of which
[]
is seen
中見
as containing a
[]
“square” of air.
方空。
Now, tell me,
吾復問汝，
is the
[]
air seen as “square”
@a@
in the square box,
此方器中，
@a@
所見方空，
really square
為復定方，
or not?
為不定方？
If so,
若定方者，
it should
[]
not be round when
@b@
“poured” into a round box.
別安圓器，
@b@
空應不圓。
If not,
若不定者，
then there should be
[]
no “square” of air

在方器中，
@c@
應無方空。
You say that

(but) the

where do you want it to “lie”?
云何為在？
Ānanda,
阿難！
if you want
若復欲令
the air to be

neither square nor round,

just

throw the box away.
除器方，
Since air

無方。
you should not
不應
again
[]
insist on
說言，
removing
更除
the place
虛空，
where it “lies.”
方相所在。
If, as you just said,
若如汝問，
when you entered this hall,
入室之時，
your seeing shrank into a small compass,
縮見令小。
then when you
[]
look at the sun,
仰觀日時，
do you lift it up
汝豈挽見，

[]
If a wall

can

can you prevent it from peeping

Therefore,

your contention

is wrong.
不然。

## Rooting Out Ānanda’s Misconception of Objects Being and NOT BEING Perception
### Misconception of objects BEING perception

The Buddha replied:
佛告
‘Ānanda,
阿難：
your conception of
今汝所言，
perception
見
being
[]
in front of you
在汝前，
is incorrect
是義非實。
because if it is,
若實汝前，
[]
汝實見者，
the essence of perception
則此見精，
should have a position
既有方所，
which
[]
can be shown.
非無指示。
As you sit in
且今與汝坐
Jetavana park,
祇陀林，
you see
遍觀
its trees and nullahs
林渠，
as well {69} as
及與
this hall,
殿堂，
with
[]
the sun or moon overhead
上至日月，
and
[]
the Ganges in the distance.
前對恒河。
As you are now,
汝今
in front of my lion-seat,
於我師子座前，
moving your hand
舉手
to point to
指陳，
the surroundings,
是種種相。
such as
[]
the dark foliage of the wood,
陰者是林。
the bright sun,
明者是日。
blocking walls
礙者是壁。
and clear open spaces
通者是空。
as well as
如是乃至，
grass,
草
plants
樹
and
[]
very small things,
纖毫，
although they are
[]
of different sizes,
大小雖殊。
each of them
但可有形，
can be pointed out.
無不指著。
If
若
they are really
必
your seeing
其見，
manifesting
現
in front of you,
在汝前。
you should be able to
[]
show which one is
汝應以手，確實指陳，
your seeing.
何者是見？

‘Ānanda,
阿難
you should know
當知，
that
[]
if
若
voidness
空
is your seeing,
是見，
since
既
it has already
已
become
成
your perception,
見，
then
[]
how can it
何者
be empty?
是空？
If
若
an (external)
[]
thing
物
is your seeing
是見，
and
[]
has already
既已
become your perception,
是見，
how can it
何者
be external?
為物？
So, after
(汝可)
dissecting
微細披剝
all things in front of you,
萬象，
pick out
析出
the bright and pure
精明淨
principle of your perception
妙見元，
and
[]
show it
指陳示
(to me)
我，
to prove that it is
[]
clearly and irrefutably
@a@
identical with externals.’
同彼諸物，
@a@
分明無惑。

Ānanda said:
阿難言：
‘From this hall, I now see
我今於此重閣講堂，
the Ganges in the distance,
遠洎恒河，
the sun or moon overhead
上觀日月，
and all that
[]
I can point out with my finger
舉手所指，
and
[]
see with my eyes;
縱目所觀，
they are all
指皆是
(external)
[]
things
物，
but
[]
not one of them
無是
is my perception.
見者。
World Honoured One,
世尊！
as the Buddha
如佛
has said,
所說，
not only
況
a beginner in
[]
the śrāvaka stage,
@a@
like myself,
我
who is still
[]
in the stream of transmigration,
有漏初學
@a@
聲聞，
but even
乃至
a Bodhisattva,
菩薩，
cannot
亦不能
dissect things
於萬物象前，
and
[]
pick out
剖出
the essence of seeing
精見，
which has
[]
an independent nature
@a@
apart from phenomena.’
離一切物，
@a@
別有自性。

The Buddha said:
佛言：
‘Correct, correct.’
如是如是。

### Misconception of objects NOT BEING perception

The Buddha said:
佛復告阿難：
‘As you have said,
如汝所言，
there is no
無有
essence of {70} seeing
見精，
with an independent nature
@a@
apart from phenomena.
離一切物，
@a@
別有自性。
Now
[]
if there is no perception
@b@
in the things
@c@
you point out,
則汝所指
@c@
是物之中，
@b@
無是見者。
I now ask again:
今復告汝。
As you and
汝與
the Tathāgata
如來，
sit in
坐
this Jetavana park,
祇陀林，
when you see the wood
更觀林苑，
and
[]
all externals
@d@
including the sun or moon,
乃至日月，
@d@
種種象殊，
if there is no
必無
essence of Seeing
見精，
which can
[]
be picked out from them,
受汝所指。
tell me
汝又發明，
which one
此諸物中，
is not the seeing?’
何者非見？

Ānanda replied:
阿難言：
‘Of all things seen in this Jetavana park,
我實遍見此祇陀林，
I do not know which one is not the seeing.
不知是中，何者非見。
Why?
何以故？
Because if the trees are not the seeing,
若樹非見，
why do I see them?
云何見樹？
If they are the seeing,
若樹即見，
why are they trees?
復云何樹？
If the void is not the seeing,
如是乃至若空非見，
why do I see it?
云何見空？
If the void is the seeing,
若空即見，
why is it empty?
復云何空？
I too have thought carefully
我又思惟，
about all this
是萬象中，
and now conclude that
微細發明，
each one of them is the seeing.’
無非見者。

The Buddha said:
佛言：
‘Correct, correct.’
如是如是。

In the assembly,
於是大眾，
all those who had
[]
not achieved
非
the stage beyond study,
無學者，
were very surprised
[]
at hearing
聞
the Buddha say this.
佛此言，
They failed to
茫然不知
understand His meaning
是義終始，
and
[]
were perturbed
一時惶悚，
and
[]
thrown off balance.
失其所守。
The Buddha
如來
realized
知
their
其
perplexity
魂慮
and alarm
變慴，
and
[]
took compassion on them,
心生憐愍，
saying:
安慰
[]
阿難，及諸大眾：
Virtuous men,
諸善男子，
the words of
[]
the King of the Supreme Law
無上法王，
are true,
是真實語，
accord with Reality
如所如說，
and are
[]
neither deceitful
不誑
nor false,
不妄。
unlike those of
非
the heretics
末伽黎，四種不死，
whose sermons are
[]
arbitrary and aimless.
矯亂論議。
Now listen attentively;
汝諦思惟，
your faith in me shall
[]
not be in vain.‘ {71}
無忝哀慕。

rose from his seat,
即從座起，
prostrated himself

brought his two palms together

there should be
應有

輕尟。
May the Tathāgata be compassionate enough

just as a second moon

又誰非月。
Mañjuśrī,
文殊，
there is only one real moon
但一月真，
which is beyond the condition of “is” and “is not.”
中間自無是月、非月。
Therefore,
是以
if you discern seeing and its objects
汝今觀見與塵，
and give rise to all kinds of (mental) creation,
種種發明，
this is wrong thinking
名為妄想。
which will prevent you from getting out of this dual condition of “is” and “is not.”
不能於中，出是、非是。
(If you look into them by means of)

show {74} clearly
甄明，
that

its substance is the self.
有自然體。
Now look into
汝且觀此
this wondrous seeing
妙明見中，
and see
[]
what is
以何
its self;
為自？
do you mean that
(此見為復，)
light,
以明
[]
為自，
darkness,
以暗
[]
為自，
clarity
以空
[]
為自，
or
[]
obstruction
以塞
is its self?
為自。
Ānanda,
阿難！
if
若
light is its self
明為自，
you
[]
should not
應不
see darkness
見暗。
and
[]
if
若
the void
復以空
[]
為自體者，
you
[]
should not
應不
see obstruction.
見塞。
[]
如是乃至
If darkness
諸暗等相，
is its self,
以為自者，
the nature of your seeing should cease to exist
@a@
when there is light;
則於明時，
@a@
見性斷滅，
if so, why do you
[]
still
云何
see light?’
見明？

Ānanda said:
阿難言：
‘If so,
必
the nature of
[]
this wondrous seeing
此妙見，
is not the self as such.
性非自然。
I now guess
我今發明，
that it is
[]
created by
@a@
cause and condition
是因緣
@a@
生。
but I am
[]
still not clear about it.
心猶未明，
I pray the Tathāgata

to teach me
[]
how this
是義云何，
accords with
合
the nature of

### Eliminating cause and condition

The Buddha said:
佛言：
‘You now speak of
汝言
cause
因
and
[]
condition.
緣，
Let
[]
me ask you this:
吾復問汝。
When you see things,
汝今因見，
the nature of seeing
見性
manifests;
現前。
does this seeing exist
此見為復，
because of
@a@
light,
因明
[]
有見？
darkness,
因暗
[]
有見？
clarity
因空
[]
有見？
or
[]
obstruction?
因塞
@a@
有見？
Ānanda,
阿難！
if
若
it exists
[]
because of light,
因明有，
you
[]
should not
應不
see darkness
見暗。
and if
如
because of darkness,
因暗有，
you
[]
should not
應不
see light;
見明。
it is the same with
如是乃至，
clarity and obstruction.
因空因塞，同於明暗。
Again,
復次
[]
阿難！
is this
此見又復，
seeing in a
@b@
bright,
緣明

有見？
dark,
緣暗
[]
有見？
clear
緣空
[]
有見？
or
[]
obstructed condition?
緣塞
@b@
有見？
Ānanda,
阿難！
if
若
it is clear,
緣空有，
you
[]
should not
應不
see any obstruction
見塞。
and
[]
if
若
it is obstructed
緣塞有，
you
[]
should not
應不
see that it is clear;
見空。
it is the same with
如是乃至，
light and darkness.
緣明緣暗，同於空塞。

### Revealing the essential Bodhi

‘Therefore, you
[]
should know
當知
that
[]
the
如是
essential Bodhi
精覺
is
[]
wondrous and bright,
妙明，
being
[]
neither cause

非緣，
neither self as such

nor not self as such,
非不自然，
neither unreality
無非、
nor not {75} unreality,
不非，
and
[]
neither reality
無是、
nor not reality,
非是，
for it is

beyond all forms
離一切相，
and is

identical with

all things (dharmā).
一切法。
How can you now
汝今云何，
think of it
於中措心？
and use

the frivolous terminology of the world

This is

for how can you

虛空云何，
@b@
隨汝執捉？

### Brushing away wrong assumptions

Ānanda asked: ‘World Honoured One,
阿難白佛言：世尊！
if
必
the nature of Wonderful Enlightenment
妙覺性，
has
[]
neither cause
非因
nor condition,
非緣。
why has the Buddha
世尊云何
always

told the bhikṣus about
與比丘宣說：
the nature of seeing

which exists

because of
具
the four conditions
四種緣？
of
所謂
voidness,
因空
light,
因明，
mind

and

eye;
因眼，
what does all this mean?’
是義云何？

The Buddha replied:
佛言：阿難！
‘I spoke of

have nothing to do with

# Eliminating the Essence of Perception to Reveal Inceptive Enlightenment
## Wiping Out Ānanda’s Discrimination

‘Ānanda,
阿難！
I now ask you this:
吾復問汝。
When a worldly man
諸世間人，

我能見。
things,
[]
what does he
云何
mean
名
by “seeing”
見？
and “not seeing”?
云何不見？
Ānanda replied:
阿難言：
‘When a worldly man
世人
sees forms by the
@a@
light of the sun, moon and lamps,
因於日月燈光，
@a@

this is called

but
若復

[]

(The Buddha asked:)

‘Ānanda,

this is

no light;
無明，
how then can
云何
there be
[]
no seeing?
無見？
Ānanda,
阿難！
in the dark,
若在暗時，
if this is called not seeing
@b@
solely because he does
[]
not see the light,
不見明故，
@b@
名為不見。
then
[]
when
今
there is light,
在明時，
if he does
[]
not
不
see darkness,
見暗相，
this is
[]
again called
還名
not seeing;
不見。
thus
[]
there would be no seeing
@c@
in both cases.
如是二相，
@c@
俱名不見。
But
[]
in these two states
若復二相，
which

自相陵奪，
the nature of your seeing
非汝見性，
does not cease for an instant.
於中暫無。
Therefore,
如是則知，
there is (actual)

how can

## Revealing the Inceptive Bodhi

‘Therefore,

#! Revealing the unreality of the two realms to expose the non-existence of Dharma (things)

Ānanda said to the Buddha:
阿難白佛言：
‘World Honoured One,
世尊！
although the Buddha
如佛世尊，
has taught us
為我等輩，宣說
about

cause

the state of

to the teaching.
[]
As we listened to
而今更聞，
His further instruction on

seeing that is not seeing,
見見非見，
we became
[]
more deluded and perplexed.
重增迷悶。
Please be compassionate enough
伏願弘慈，
to open our wisdom-eye
施大慧目，
to enlighten us.’
開示我等，覺心明淨。
After saying this,
作是語已，
he shed bitter tears,
悲淚
prostrated himself at the Buddha’s feet
頂禮，
and
[]
waited for the holy teaching.
承受聖旨。

The Buddha
爾時世尊，
took pity on
憐愍
Ānanda
阿難，
and the assembly
及諸大眾。
and

was about to

敷演
the profound practice
@a@
of the samādhis
@b@
of the great Dhāraṇī
大陀羅尼，
@b@
諸三摩提，
@a@
妙修行路。
when he said to Ānanda:
告阿難言：
‘Though you
汝雖
have tried to

強記，
(my Dharma),
p[
you have only

菩提果。

‘Ānanda,
阿難！
all living beings
一切眾生，
are

subject to transmigration
輪迴
through various worlds
世間，
because of
由
two inverted,
二顛倒，
discriminative
分別
and

wrong views
見妄，
which,

wherever they occur,
當處發生，
cause {79} people to be
[]
caught in the turning wheel of saṃsāra.
當業輪轉。
What causes
云何
these two wrong views?
二見？
They are due to their
(一者，) 眾生
individual
別業妄見。
and
(二者，)
[]
眾生
collective karmas.
同分妄見。

## Individual Karma

‘What is
云何名為
the individual karma
別業
that causes
[]
wrong views?
妄見？
Ānanda,
阿難！
it is like a man who,
如世間人，
because
[]
his eyes are inflamed,
目有赤眚，
sees at night
夜見燈光，
a five-coloured circle
@a@
round the light of a lamp.
別有圓影，
@a@
五色重疊。
[]
於意云何？
[]
此夜燈明
Is this circle
所現圓光，
the colour of the flame
為是燈色？
or
為
that of his seeing?
當見色？
[]
阿難！
If it is
此若
the colour of the flame,
燈色，
why
則
does only the man with bad eyes see it
[]
while others do not?
非眚人，何不同見？
If it is the colour of
而此圓影，
his seeing,
唯眚之觀。
since
若
his seeing
是見色，
is already
見已
that colour,
成色，
[]
則彼眚人，
[]
見圓影者，
what do you call the circle?
名為何等？
Moreover,
復次
Ānanda,
阿難！
if
若
this circle
此圓影，
is independent of the lamp,
離燈別有，
the man should
[]
see it when
@b@
looking at nearby curtains, tables and mats;
則合傍觀，屏帳几筵，
@b@
有圓影出。
if it is
[]
independent of the seeing,
離見別有，
it should not be
應非
seen by the eyes,
眼矚，
but
[]
why does the man with bad eyes
云何眚人，
see it?
目見圓影？
Therefore,
是故
you should know that
當知，
this colour
色
is revealed by
實在
the lamplight
燈，
and
[]
becomes a circle
@c@
when perceived by defective seeing;
見病
@c@
為影。
both
[]
the circle (form)
影
and
[]
the seeing
見
(perception)
[]
are due to
俱
bad eyes,
眚，
but
[]
that which recognizes this disease
見眚
is not sick.
非病。
Thus you
終
should not
不應
(discriminate and)
[]
say that
言，
it is
[]
either the lamp
是燈
or the seeing,
是見，
with the further idea
於是中有，
of it being
[]
neither the lamp
非燈
nor the seeing.
非見。
It is
[]
like
如
a second moon
第二月，
which is
[]
neither the real moon
非體
nor its shadow.
非影。
Why?
何以故？
Because
[]
the sight of this second moon
第二之觀，
is an illusory creation.
捏所成故。
So
[]
wise people
諸有智者，
should not say
不應說言，
that
[]
this illusion
此捏根元，
“is” or
是形
“is not” form
非形，
or that it
[]
exists apart from seeing
離見
or {80} non-seeing.
非見。
In the same way
此亦如是，
how can you prove that
@b@
an illusion caused by bad eyes
目眚所成，
@b@
今欲名誰，
is (due to) the lamp
是燈
or to your seeing?
是見。
Still less can you
何況
establish that
分別，
it is (due to)
[]
neither the lamp
非燈
nor your seeing.
非見。

## Collective Karma

‘What is
云何名為
the collective karma
同分妄見？
that causes wrong views?
[]
Ānanda,
阿難！
this universe (Jambudvīpa)

200, or 300 countries.
兩三百國。
Ānanda,
阿難！
[]
若復此中，
in a small continent
有一小洲，
there (may) be
[]
only two countries,
祇有兩國。
one of which
唯一國人，
is inhabited by people who,
@a@
as a result of
同感
their evil karma,

[]
則彼小洲，

of them.
[]

‘Ānanda, let us
阿難！吾今為汝，
compare these two karmic conditions
以此二事，進退合明。
(dealing first with wrong views caused by individual karma which are similar to those by collective karma).
[]
Ānanda,
阿難！
all living beings
如彼眾生，
whose
[]
individual karma
別業
causes them
[]
to see wrongly,
妄見，
are like the man who because his eyes are inflamed,
[]
sees around the light of a lamp
矚燈光中
a circle
所現圓影，
which
[]
seems to be out there
雖現
in front of him,
似境，
but in fact
[]
exists because
終
his sight is disturbed;
彼見者，目眚所成。
[]
眚即見勞，
this circle is
[]
not created by form.
非色所造。
However the (faculty of) seeing through which he is
[]
aware of this trouble,
然見眚者，
is free from it.
終無見咎。
Similarly
例汝今日，
if you now look at
以目觀見
mountains,
山
rivers
河
and
[]
the country
國土。
with its inhabitants,
及諸眾生，
they are all created by
皆是
a {81} disturbance in your seeing
@a@
since the time without beginning.
無始
@a@
見病所成。
Though this
[]
seeing
見
and its causal externals
與見緣，
seem to be
似現
(phenomena)
[]
in front of you,
前境。
they originally arise from
[]
your (subjective)
元我
awareness
覺
of that
[]
brightness
明，
(of Reality) which leads to a (wrong)
[]
perception
見所
of (objective)
[]
causal falsities.
緣眚，
Thus
[]
awareness
覺
and
[]
perception
見
(cause)
[]
wrong seeing,
即眚。
but
[]
the bright true Mind of basic Bodhi
本覺
which sees clearly
明心，
these causal states
[]
is free from all ills.
覺緣非眚。
That which
覺所
realizes this awareness
覺
as faulty
眚，
does not fall into
覺非
delusion.
眚中。
This is
此
(what I mean by true)
實見
seeing
見，
that is not (discriminative and about which you asked for elucidation).
[]
How can this be
云何復名，
comprehended by your (discriminative)
[]
seeing,
覺
hearing,
聞
feeling
知
and
[]
knowing?
見？
Therefore,
是故
your actual
汝今
seeing
見
of me, of yourself,
我及汝，
and of living beings of
并諸世間
the ten types of birth
十類眾生，
is a disturbance of your seeing
皆即見眚。
and certainly
[]
not
非
that which is aware of your
[]
wrong seeing.
見眚者，
For the basic nature of
[]
the true essence of perception
彼見真精，
is beyond all ills:
性非眚者，
hence it is
[]
not called
故不名
seeing.
見。

‘Ānanda,
阿難！
let us now compare
[]
wrong seeing caused by collective karma
如彼眾生，同分妄見，
with

that by individual karma.

If so, does your

essence of perception
妙淨見精，
mix
@b@
with light,
為與明(和？)
or darkness,
為與暗(和？)
with clarity,
為與通(和？)

為與塞
@b@
和？
If
若
it mixes with light,
明和者，
when the latter appears
@c@
and you see it,
且汝觀明，
@c@
當明現前，
where does it
何處
mix with your seeing?
雜見？
Since your seeing is clear,
見相可辨，
where can you find such mixture?
雜何形像？
If
若
it is not the seeing,
非見者，
why do you see light?
云何見明？
If
若
it is the seeing,
即見者，
how can you see
云何見
your own seeing?
見？
Since your seeing is complete by itself,
必見圓滿，
how can it be
何處
mixed with the light?
和明？
Since light is complete by itself,
若明圓滿，
where can it
不合
contain your seeing?
見和，
Therefore,
[]
seeing and light differ,
見必異明。
and
[]
if they are mixed up,
雜則
even the word “light”
@d@
would cease to exist;
失彼，
@d@
性明名字。
in other words,
[]
such a mixture
雜
would suppress

明性，
Consequently, your concept of
[]
a mixture of seeing with light
和明
is wrong,
非義。
and so is
@e@
a mixture of seeing with
彼
darkness,
暗
clarity
與通，
and
及

諸群塞，
@e@
亦復如是。

‘Again, Ānanda,
復次阿難！

If
若
it unites {84} with light,

then
[]
when light vanishes

is replaced by darkness,
明相已滅，
the seeing
此見
should not
即不
unite with the latter,
與諸暗合，
but
[]
why do you still
云何
see darkness?
見暗？
When you see darkness,
若見暗時，
if your seeing does not
不與
unite with it,
暗合，
then
[]
when it unites with light,
與明合者，
you should not
應非

見明。
If light is not seen,
既不見明，
then
[]
when there is light,
云何明合，
do you know that it is

light

not darkness?
非暗？
Likewise, a union of the seeing with

彼暗

is equally false.’
亦復如是。

Ānanda asked: ‘World Honoured One,
阿難白佛言：世尊！
I am thinking
如我思惟，
again about
[]
this enlightened substance;
此妙覺元，
does it
[]
neither mix nor unite
@a@
with causal externals
與諸緣塵，
and

@a@
非和合耶。

The Buddha replied:
佛言：
‘You now speak of
汝今又言 (覺)
not mixing
非和
and
[]
not uniting.
合。
Do you mean that
吾復問汝。
this essence of seeing
此妙見精
does not mix
非和合者，
with light,
為非明和？
darkness,
為非暗和？
clarity
為非通和？
and
[]

為非塞和？
If so,
若非明和，
then
[]
when you see the light,
則見與明，
there should be
必有
a demarcation line
邊畔。
between seeing and light.
[]
Now look carefully
汝且諦觀，
(and tell me)
[]
where are the fields of light
何處是明，
and
[]
of your seeing,
何處是見，
and
[]
where are their
在見在明，
boundaries:
自何為畔。
Ānanda,
阿難！
if you do not see where light is,
若明際中必無見者，
then
則
your seeing will not reach it;
不相及，
if so,
[]
you will not even know
自不知
where the light is,
其明相所在，
and how
[]
can there be a border line?
畔云何成。
It is the same with
@a@
darkness,
彼暗
clarity
與通，

obstruction.
諸群塞，
@a@
亦復如是。

‘Again, do you mean that

this essence of seeing

If

both the seeing and light

So

# Fusing Myriads of Things with the Absolute to Reveal the Identity of Phenomenon with Noumenon
## Fusing the Five Aggregates

‘Ānanda,
阿難！
why are
云何
the five aggregates
五陰，
fundamentally
本
@a@
如來藏，
the wondrous nature of the Absolute of
妙真如性？
the Tathāgata store?
@a@

### The First Aggregate Rūpa

Ānanda,
阿難！
for instance,
譬如
when a man
有人，
looks at a clear sky
@b@
with clear eyes,
以清淨目，
@b@
觀晴明空，
he sees
[]
only the void
唯一晴虛，
which contains nothing.
迴無所有。
If suddenly
[]
without any apparent reason
其人無故，
he steadies his seeing,
不動目睛，
it will be disturbed
瞪以發勞，
and
[]
he will see flowers dancing
@c@
and other objects moving
@d@
in the sky.
則於虛空，
@c@
別見狂華，
@d@
復有一切狂亂非相。
It is the same with
@e@
the aggregate rūpa.
色陰當知，
@e@
亦復如是。
Ānanda,
阿難！
these dancing flowers
是諸狂華，
come neither from the void
非從空來，
nor from his eyes.
非從目出。
[]
如是阿難，
If
若
they came from the void,
空來者，
they would
(既從空來，)
return to it;
還從空入。
if
若
there was really such a
[]
coming and going
有出入，
of these flowers,
[]
the void would not be empty.
即非虛空。
If voidness was really not empty
空若非空，
(i.e. if it was solid),
[]
then
自
they could not
不容其華相
appear
起
and
[]
vanish
滅。
in it.
[]
This is like
如
Ānanda’s (solid) body {87}
阿難體，
which
[]
does not allow
不容
(another)
[]
Ānanda
阿難。
to enter it.
[]
If
若
these flowers
[]
come from the eyes,
目出者，
they should be able to
(既從目出，)
return to the eyes,
還從目入。
and
[]
because they come
即此華性
from (the faculty of) seeing,
從目出故，
they should be able to see
當合有見。
(things). Thus
[]
when they leave the eyes,
若有見者，
they become flowers in the sky
去既華空，
and
[]
when they return,
旋
they should
合
see the organ of sight.
見眼。
If
若
they cannot see (things),
無見者，
then
[]
when they leave,
出既
they should screen the sky
翳空，
and
[]
when they return,
旋
they should veil the eyes;
當翳眼。
but
[]
when the man sees these flowers,
又見華時，
his eyes are not veiled.
目應無翳。
Then
[]
why do you
云何
wait until the sky is clear
睛空，
(of these flowers)
[]
to say that
號
your eyes are really clear?
清明眼？
Therefore,
[]
you should know
是故當知，
that the
[]
first aggregate form
色陰
is unreal
虛妄，
for it is
本
neither causal
非因
nor conditional
緣，
nor self-existent.
非自然性。

### The Second Aggregate Vedanā

‘Ānanda,
阿難！
when, for instance,
譬如
a man
有人，
is in good health and
[]
his limbs are in good condition,
手足宴安，
he does not feel anything.
百骸調適，
But if suddenly,
忽(如忘生，性無違順。)
without any reason,
其人無故，
he rubs his palms together,
以二手掌，於空相摩，
[]
於二手中，
he feels
妄生
coarseness,
澀
smoothness,
滑，
cold
冷
and warmth.
熱諸相。
It is the same with
@a@
the second aggregate vedanā.
受陰當知，
@a@
亦復如是。
Ānanda,
阿難！
these sensations
是諸幻觸，
come from neither the void
不從空來，
nor his palms.
不從掌出。
[]
如是阿難，
If
若
they
[]
come from the void,
空來者，
why are they felt by his palms only
既能觸掌，
and
[]
not by his body?
何不觸身。
It should not be up to the void
不應虛空，
to choose his palms to feel them.
選擇來觸。
If they come from his palms,
若從掌出，
they should not wait for
應非待
the palms to be brought together
合。
to be {88} felt. Moreover,
[]
if they really come from his palms
又掌出故，
and
[]
are felt
合則
when the latter are brought together,
掌知，
when they are separated,
離則
these sensations should
[]
re-enter the palms,
觸入，
arms,
臂
shoulders,
腕
bones
骨
and
[]
marrow
髓，
which
[]
should also feel
應亦覺知，
their re-entry.
入時蹤跡。
They
[]
should also be felt by the mind
必有覺心，
as coming in and out,
知出知入。
as if
[]
something
自有一物，
had moved in and out of the body.
身中往來。
If so, there is
[]
no need to
何待
bring the two
[]
palms together
合
to feel
知，
these sensations.
要名為觸。

Therefore,
是故
you should know that
當知，
the aggregate vedanā is unreal
受陰虛妄，
and is
[]
neither causal
本非因
nor conditional
緣，
nor self-existent.
非自然性。

### The Third Aggregate Sañjña

‘Ānanda,
阿難！
if someone
譬如有人，
speaks of sour plums,
談說酢梅，
your mouth will water,
口中水出。
and if you
[]
think
思
of walking
[]
above an overhanging cliff,
蹋懸崖，
you will have the
[]
sensation of shivering
@a@
in the soles of your feet.
足心
@a@
酸澀。
This is the same with
@b@
the third aggregate sañjñā.
想陰當知，
@b@
亦復如是。
Ānanda,
阿難！
this talk of sourness
如是酢說，
does not come from the plum,
不從梅生，
nor does it enter your mouth.
非從口入。
[]
如是阿難，
If
若
it comes from the plum,
梅生者，
it should be
[]
spoken of by the plum itself;
梅合自談，
then
[]
why does it wait
何待
for someone to speak
人說。
of it?
[]
If
若
it enters your mouth,
從口入，
it should be
自合
your mouth
口
which actually
[]
talks about it;
聞，
then
[]
why does it wait
何須
until your ears hear
待耳。
of it?
[]
If it is
若
your ears which alone hear it,
獨耳聞，
why does not that water
此水何不
come out of them?
耳中而出。
This is the same with
@c@
your thought of
想
(walking above)
[]
an over-hanging cliff.
蹋懸崖，
@c@
與說相類。
Therefore,
是故
you should know that
當知，
the third aggregate sañjñā is
想陰虛妄，
neither causal
本非因
nor conditional
緣，
nor self-existent. {89}
非自然性。

### The Fourth Aggregate Saṃskāra

‘Ānanda,
阿難！
the fourth aggregate saṃskāra is
[]
like
譬如
water which flows in a torrent
瀑流，
endlessly
波浪相續，
and in good order over a fall.
前際後際，不相踰越。
[]
行陰當知，亦復如是。
Ānanda,
阿難！
this flow
如是流性，
does not come from the void
不因空生，
nor is it due to the water;
不因水有，
it is
[]
neither the water itself
亦非水性，
nor does it exist apart from
非離
the void
空
and
[]
the water.
水。
[]
如是阿難，
If
若
it is created by the void,
因空生，
boundless space
則諸十方無盡虛空，
would become
成
an endless flow of water
無盡流，
and the whole
[]
world
世界
would be submerged.
自然俱受淪溺。
If
若
it is due to the water,
因水有，
then
則(此瀑流性)
it should not be water
應非水，
and
[]
should have its own form
有所有相，
and
[]
location
今應現在。
which should be apparent.
[]
If
若
it is water,
即水性，
then
則
still and clear water
澄清時，
should not be
應非
water.
水體。
If
若
it exists apart from
離
the void
空
and
[]
water,
水，
(this is impossible because)
[]
space
空
(is all-embracing and)
[]
has (nothing) outside
非有外，
(it)
[]
and because
[]
there is no flow without water.
水外無流。
Therefore,
是故
you should know that
當知，
the fourth aggregate saṃskāra is false
行陰虛妄，
and
[]
is neither causal
本非因
nor conditional
緣，
nor self-existent.
非自然性。

### The Fifth Aggregate Viñāna

‘Ānanda,
阿難！
the (fifth) aggregate consciousness is
[]
like
譬如有人，
the void in
[]
an empty
@a@
pitcher with two mouths.
取頻伽缾，
If someone
[]
blocks both mouths
塞其兩孔，
and
[]
@a@
滿中擎空，
carries it to another country,
千里遠行，用餉他國。
[]
識陰當知，亦復如是。
[]
阿難！如是
the void
虛空，
does not go from
非彼方來，
one place to another.
非此方入，
[]
如是阿難，
If
若
the void comes from somewhere,
彼方來，
that place
[]
should lose some of its voidness,
則本缾中既貯空去，
and
[]
on arrival elsewhere,
於本缾地，
[]
應少虛空。
when the mouths are opened and
(若此方入，)
the pitcher reversed,
開孔倒缾，
one should see the void poured out of it.
應見空出。
Therefore
[]
you should know
是故當知，
that
[]
consciousness is unreal
識陰虛妄，
and
[]
is neither causal
本非因
nor conditional
緣，
nor self-existent.‘ {90}
非自然性。

{V3}

## Fusing the Six Entrances

‘Again,
復次
Ānanda,
阿難！
why are
云何
the six entrances
六入，
(of illusions into the mind)
[]
fundamentally
本
the absolute nature of
@a@
the Tathāgata store.
如來藏，
@a@
妙真如性？

### Entrance through the Eyes

Ānanda,
阿難！
the steadying of the seeing
即彼目睛，
that disturbs the sight,
瞪發勞者，
as well as
兼
the eyes
目
and
與
the disturbance
勞，
itself
[]
are but trouble
@a@
arising from Bodhi.
同是菩提，
@a@
瞪發勞相。
Because
因於
the seeing arises between
@b@
the two states of light and darkness,
明暗二種妄塵，
@b@
發見居中，
they are
[]
drawn into (ālaya’s) perception
吸此塵象，
which is called
名為
the (faculty of)
[]
seeing.
見性。
This seeing
此見
has no independent substance that exists
@c@
apart from the two states of light and dark.
離彼明暗二塵，
@c@
畢竟無體。
Therefore, Ānanda,
如是阿難，
you should know that
當知
this seeing
是見，
comes from
@d@
neither light,
非明
nor darkness
暗
@d@
來，
and from
[]
neither the organ of sight
非於根出，
nor the void.
不於空生。
Why? Because
何以故？
if
若
it comes from light,
從明來，
it would
[]
cease to exist
@e@
when darkness appears
暗即
@e@
隨滅，
and
[]
would not
應非
perceive the latter.
見暗。
If
若
it comes from darkness,
從暗來，
it would be no more
@f@
when there is light,
明即
@f@
隨滅，
and
[]
would not
應無
perceive the latter.
見明。
If
若
it comes from the organ
從根生，
(of sight),
[]
there would be no
必無
(objective)
[]
light
明
and
[]
darkness;
暗。
then
[]
such essence of perception
如是見精，
would have
[]
no nature of its own.
本無自性。
If
若
it comes from the void,
於空出，
when it perceives these two states,
前矚塵象，
it would also see the
歸當見
organ of sight.
根。
Moreover,
又
the void
空
would thus
[]
perceive everything of itself
自觀，
and
[]
have nothing {91} to do with
何關
entrance through your eyes.
汝入。
Therefore,
是故
you should know that
當知，
entrance through the eyes
眼入
is false
虛妄，
and
[]
is neither causal
本非因
nor conditional
緣，
nor self-existent.
非自然性。

### Entrance through the Ears

‘Ānanda,
阿難！
if a man suddenly
譬如有人，
closes his ears with two fingers,
以兩手指急塞其耳，
disturbance will arise in this sense organ
耳根勞故，
and he will
[]
hear sounds in his head.
頭中作聲，
(This, closing of the ears)
[]
as well as
兼
the ears
耳
and
與
the disturbance experienced
勞，
are trouble that comes from Bodhi.
同是菩提瞪發勞相。
Since this hearing arises between
@a@
the two states of stillness and motion,
因於動靜二種妄塵，
@a@
發聞居中，
they are
[]
drawn into (ālaya’s) perception
吸此塵象，
which is called
名聽
hearing.
聞性。
This hearing
此聞
has no substance
@b@
independent of stillness and motion.
離彼動靜二塵，
@b@
畢竟無體。
如是
[]
Ānanda,
阿難，
you should know that
當知
this hearing comes from
是聞，
neither stillness, nor motion,
非動靜來，
nor from a sense organ
非於根出，
nor the void.
不於空生。
Why?
何以故？
Because
[]
if
若
it comes from stillness,
從靜來，
it should
[]
cease to exist when there is motion
動即隨滅，
and would not hear the latter.
應非聞動。
If it comes from motion,
若從動來，
it should
[]
cease to exist when there is stillness
靜即隨滅，
and would not hear the latter.
應無覺靜。
If it comes from a sense organ,
若從根生，
there would be no
必無
(objective)
[]
stillness nor motion;
動靜。
then
[]
this faculty of hearing
如是聞體，
would have no nature of its own.
本無自性。
If it comes from the void,
若於空出，
that which can hear
有聞成性，
is (certainly)
[]
not the void.
即非虛空。
Moreover,
又
the void
空
would hear of itself
自聞，
and
[]
will have nothing to do with
何關
that entrance through your ears.
汝入。
Therefore,
是故
you should know that
當知，
entrance through the ears
耳入
is unreal,
虛妄。
and
[]
is neither causal
本非因
nor conditional
緣，
nor self-existent. {92}
非自然性。

### Entrance through the Nose

‘Ānanda,
阿難！
if a man suddenly
譬如有人，
holds his breath,
急畜其鼻，
[]
畜久成勞，
his nostrils will feel cold.
則於鼻中，聞有冷觸，
Because of this feeling,
因觸分別，
he can distinguish
[]
clearance
通
(ventilation)
[]
from obstruction
塞
(suffocation)
[]
and emptiness
虛
from fullness
實，
and
[]
can smell fragrant and offensive odours.
如是乃至諸香臭氣，
This restraint of breath as well as
[]
the nose and its feeling
兼鼻與勞，
are trouble
@a@
that comes from Bodhi.
同是菩提
@a@
瞪發勞相。
Since feeling arises between
@b@
the two false conditions
@c@
of clearance and obstruction,
因於通塞
@c@
二種妄塵，
@b@
發聞居中，
sensations are drawn into (ālaya’s) perception
吸此塵象，
which is called
名
smell.
嗅聞性。
This smell
此聞
has no substance
@d@
independent of clearance and obstruction.
離彼通基二塵，
@d@
畢竟無體。
You should know that it comes
當知是聞，
neither from these two states
非通塞來，
nor from the nose
非於根出，
nor the void.
不於空生。
Why?
何以故？
Because if it comes from the clearance,
若從通來，
it will cease to exist
@e@
when there is obstruction;
塞則
@e@
聞滅，
but
[]
why does it
云何
feel the latter?
知塞。
If
如
it comes from obstruction,
因塞有，
it will cease to be clear;
通則無聞，
but
[]
why does it
云何
come into contact with fragrance and stench?
發明香臭等觸。
If
若
it comes from a sense organ,
從根生，
there would be
[]
no (objective) clearance and obstruction;
必無通塞。
then
[]
this faculty of smelling
如是聞機，
would have no nature of its own.
本無自性。
If
若
it comes from the void,
從空出，
it should be able to
是聞自當
smell your own nose;
迴嗅汝鼻。
if so,
[]
the void itself would smell
空自有聞，
and
[]
would have nothing to do with
何關
that entrance through your nose.
汝入。
Therefore,
是故
you should know that
當知
that entrance
鼻入
is unreal,
虛妄。
and
[]
is neither causal

非自然性。

### Entrance through the Tongue

‘Ānanda,
阿難！
if, for instance, a man
譬如有人，
licks his lips
以舌舐吻，
again and again,
熟舐
he will
[]
have trouble
令勞。
(with his sense of taste);
[]
if he is ill,
其人若病，
he will {93} experience a bitter taste,
則有苦味。
and if he is healthy,
無病之人，
a (somewhat) sweet one.
微有甜觸。
Thus
[]
bitterness
由甜
and sweetness
與苦，
reveal this sense
顯此舌根，
which is
[]
always tasteless
@a@
in the absence of stirring (feelings)
不動之時，
@a@
淡性常在。
and which,
[]
together with the tongue
兼舌
and the trouble
與勞，
(caused by the taste)
[]
are but illusion
@b@
which comes from Bodhi.
同是菩提
@b@
瞪發勞相。
This illusion is due to false externals
@c@
(such as)
[]
bitterness and sweetness
因甜苦淡
@c@
二種妄塵，
[]
發知居中，
and
[]
is drawn into (ālaya’s) perception
吸此塵象，
which is called taste.
名知味性。
This taste
此知味性，
has no independent substance
@d@
apart from
離彼
(such as)
@e@
sweetness
甜
and
[]
bitterness,
苦
and
及
tastelessness.
淡
@e@
二塵，
@d@
畢竟無體。
Ānanda,
如是阿難，
you should know that
當知
this perception of taste comes
如是嘗苦淡知，
neither from
非
the flavours (such as) sweetness and bitterness
甜苦來，
nor tastelessness,
非因淡有，
nor from a sense organ
又非根出，
nor the void.
不於空生。
Why?
何以故？
Because
[]
if
若
it comes from sweetness and bitterness,
甜苦來，
it will vanish
@f@
in the state of tastelessness;
淡則
@f@
知滅，
but
[]
why does
云何
it feel the latter?
知淡。
If
若
it comes from tastelessness,
從淡出，
it will disappear
@g@
when in touch with sweets;
甜即
@g@
知亡，
but
[]
why does
復云何知
it still feel
[]
sweet and bitter tastes?
甜苦二相。
If
若
it comes from the tongue,
從舌生，
the latter originally is
[]
neither tasteless
必無甜淡
nor sweet nor bitter;
及與苦塵。
hence we know that
[]
the organ of taste
斯知味根，
has no nature of its own.
本無自性。
If
若
it comes from the void,
於空出，
the latter
[]
not being your mouth,
@h@
would taste by itself;
虛空自味，
@h@
非汝口知。
then
[]
what has it to do with that
又空自知，
entrance through your tongue?
何關汝入。
Therefore,
是故
you should know that
當知，
this entrance is unreal
舌入虛妄。
and
[]
is neither causal
本非因
nor conditional
緣，
nor self-existent.
非自然性。

### Entrance through the Body

‘Ānanda,
阿難！
for instance, when a man
譬如有人，
touches his warm hand
@a@
with his cold one,
以一冷手。
@a@
觸於熱手。
if the coldness
若冷
exceeds the warmth,
勢多，
the warm hand
熱者
will become cold
從冷。
and
[]
if the warmth
若熱
exceeds the {94} coldness,
功勝，
the cold hand
冷者
will become warm.
成熱。
This touch is revealed
@b@
when the two hands
如是以此
meet and then separate.
合覺之觸，
@b@
顯於離知。
This contact causes
@c@
the feeling of touch which,
涉勢若成，
@c@
因於勞觸。
together with his body
兼身
and the illusion experienced,
與勞，
are but trouble
@d@
which comes from Bodhi.
同是菩提
@d@
瞪發勞相。
This trouble occurs
@e@
where
[]
there are two false conditions
@f@
of contact and separation,
因於離合
@f@
二種妄塵，
@e@
發覺居中，
and is drawn into (ālaya’s) perception
吸此塵象。
which is called touch.
名知覺性。
This touch has
[]
no independent nature
@g@
[]
此知覺體，
apart from
離彼
contact and separation
離合
and
[]
from pleasant and disagreeable conditions.
違順二塵，
@g@
畢竟無體。
Ānanda,
如是阿難，
you should know that
當知
this perception of touch comes
是覺，
neither from contact nor separation,
非離合來，
nor from pleasant
非違
nor disagreeable conditions,
順有，
nor from a sense organ
不於根出，
nor the void.
又非空生。
Why?
何以故？
Because
[]
if
若
it comes from contact,
合時來，
it should vanish
@h@
in the state of separation;
離當
@h@
已滅，
but
[]
why does it
云何
feel the latter?
覺離。
It is the same with
@i@
pleasant and disagreeable conditions.
違順二相，
@i@
亦復如是。
If
若
it comes from a sense organ,
從根出，
it would be free from
必無
contact and separation and
離合
from pleasant and disagreeable conditions;
違順
[]
四相。
then
[]
your body that feels them
則汝身知，
would have no nature of its own.
元無自性。
If it comes from the void,
必於空出，
the latter will feel the touch by itself;
空自知覺，
then
[]
what has it to do with your
何關
entrance through the body?
汝入。
Therefore,
是故
you should know that
當知
this entrance is false
身入虛妄。
and
[]
is neither causal
本非因
nor conditional
緣，
nor self-existent.
非自然性。

### Entrance through the Intellect

‘Ānanda,
阿難！
when for instance, a man
譬如有人，
is tired, he sleeps soundly;
勞倦則眠，
then he awakes
睡熟便寤，
and when he sees objects,
[]
he remembers
覽塵斯憶，
and after a time
[]
forgets all about them.
失憶為忘，
This is the inverted condition of
是其顛倒
birth,
生
stay,
住
change
異
and
[]
death
滅，
which is continuously {95}
[]
drawn into the inner intellect;
吸習中歸，
[]
不相踰越，
hence
稱
the organ of manas,
意知根。
which,
[]
together with
兼
the intellect
意
and
與
the trouble
勞，
(experienced)
[]
are an illness
@a@
arising in Bodhi.
同是菩提
@a@
瞪發勞相。
This illness comes from perceiving
[]
the two false conditions
@b@
of birth and death,
因於生滅
@b@
二種妄塵，
a perception which covers all inner data
集知居中，吸撮內塵，
that cannot be reached by seeing and hearing;
見聞逆流，流不及地，
hence
[]
it is called
名
knowing.
覺知性。
This knowing
此覺知性，
has no substance of its own
@c@
apart from
離
the waking and sleeping states
彼寤寐
and from
[]
the conditions of birth and death.
生滅二塵，
@c@
畢竟無體。
Thus, Ānanda,
如是阿難，
you should know that
當知
the organ of knowing
如是覺知之根，
comes
@d@
neither from the waking
非寤
and
[]
sleeping states,
寐
@d@
來，
nor from the conditions
非
of birth
生
and death,
滅
[]
有，
and
[]
neither from a sense organ
不於根出，
nor the void.
亦非空生。
Why?
何以故？
Because
[]
if
若
it comes from the waking state,
從寤來，
it should
[]
cease to exist
@e@
in the sleeping state;
寐即
@e@
隨滅，
then
[]
why does one sleep?
將何為寐。
If it comes from birth,
必生時有，
it should be void
@f@
at death;
滅即
@f@
同無，
then who will die?
令誰受滅。
If
若
it comes from death,
從滅有，
it would cease
@g@
at birth;
生即
@g@
滅無，
then
[]
who is living?
誰知生者。
If
若
it comes from a sense organ,
從根出
then while the
[]
body experiences
寤寐二相
the two states of waking and sleeping,
隨身開合，
the knowing has
[]
no nature of its own
@h@
apart from these two states
離斯二體，
and will be
(此覺知者，)
like a flower in the sky.
同於空華，
@h@
畢竟無性。
If
若
it comes from the void,
從空生，
the latter will know everything
自是空知，
and
[]
will have nothing to do with your
何關
entrance through the intellect.
汝入。
Therefore,
是故當知，
this entrance is
意入虛妄。
neither causal
本非因
nor conditional
緣，
nor self-existent.'
非自然性。

## Fusing the Twelve Āyatana (Six Sense Organs & Six Sense Data)

‘Again, Ānanda,
復次阿難！
the twelve āyatana
云何十二處，
are fundamentally
本
(the same as)
[]
the Absolute of
@a@
the Tathāgata store.
如來藏
@a@
妙真如性。

### Eyes & Form

‘Ānanda,
阿難！
just {96} look at
汝且觀此
the grove and stream in
@a@
Jetavana park;
祇陀樹林，
@a@
及諸泉池。
[]
於意云何。
Is it
此等為是
form that creates the eyes’ seeing
色生眼見，
or vice versa?
眼生色相。
[]
阿難！
If
若
the organ of sight
復眼根，
creates
生
form,
色相者。
when you see the void
見空
which is not form,
非色，
form would vanish,
色性應銷。
which means that
(銷則顯發)
nothing would exist.
一切都無。
Then if
[]
form
色
is no more,
相既無，
what can be used
誰明
to reveal the void?
空質。
It is the same with the
@b@
void.
空
@b@
亦如是。
If
若
form produces
復色塵，
the eyes’ seeing,
生眼見者，
when you see the void
觀空
which is not form,
非色，
your seeing
見即
would vanish,
銷亡。
which means that
[]
nothing would exist;
亡則都無，
then
[]
who distinguishes the void
誰明空
from form?
色。
Therefore,
是故
you should know that
當知
neither seeing
見與
nor form
色
nor the void
空，
has a place of abode,
俱無處所。
and that
[]
form
即色
and seeing
與見，
are false
二處虛妄。
and
[]
are neither causal
本非因
nor conditional
緣，
nor self-existent.
非自然性。

### Ears & Sound

‘Ānanda,
阿難！
in Jetavana park
@a@
when you hear
汝更聽
@a@
此祇陀園中，
a drum beat to
@b@
announce a meal
食辦
@b@
擊鼓，
and
[]
a bell rung to
@c@
summon the bhikṣus,
眾集
@c@
撞鐘，
these sounds
鐘鼓音聲，
succeed one another;
前後相續。
[]
於意云何。
do they
此等為是
come to the ears
聲來耳邊，
or do the ears
耳往
go to them?
聲處。
Ānanda,
阿難！
if
若
they come to the ears,
復此聲，來於耳邊，
it is like
如
when I go to Śrāvastī to
@d@
我乞食
beg for food
@d@
室羅筏城。
and
[]
am absent from Jetavana park.
在祇陀林，則無有我。
If these sounds come to Ānanda’s ears,
此聲必來阿難耳處。
Maudgalaputra
目連
and
[]
Kāśyapa
迦葉，
should not hear them.
應不俱聞。
Then
[]
why do all
何況其中
the 1,250 bhikṣus,
一千二百五十沙門，
when they hear the bell,
一聞鐘聲。
go together
同來
to the eating hall?
食處。
If
若
your ears
復汝耳，
go to the sound,
往彼聲邊。
it is like
如
when I return to
我歸住
Jetavana park
祇陀林中。
and
[]
am not in Śrāvaśtī.
在室羅城，則無有我。
Then
[]
when you hear the drum,
汝聞鼓聲，
if your ears go to it,
其耳已往擊鼓之處，
you should not hear the bell
@e@
which rings at the same time,
鐘聲齊出，
@e@
應不俱聞。
nor the sound of
何況其中
elephants,
象
horses,
馬
buffaloes
牛
and
[]
sheep
羊，
(in this park).
(種種音響。)
If
若
there {97} is
[]
no
無
 such coming and going,
來往，
there would be no hearing.
亦復無聞。
Therefore,
是故
you should know that
當知
hearing and sound
聽與音聲，
have no location
俱無處所，
and that
即聽與聲，
both are false,
二處虛妄。
being
本
neither causal
非因
nor conditional
緣，
nor self-existent.
非自然性。

### Nose & Smell

‘Ānanda,
阿難！
just smell
汝又嗅此
the smoke of sandalwood in this burner.
鑪中栴檀，
The quantity burnt is small
此香若復然於一銖，
but
[]
its fragrance spreads to
@a@
Śrāvastī and the neighbourhood.
室羅筏城四十里內，
@a@
同時聞氣。
Do you think that
於意云何。
this perfume
此香為復
comes from the sandalwood,
生栴檀木，
from your nose,
生於汝鼻，
or from the void?
為生於空。
Ānanda,
阿難！
if
若
it comes from your nose,
復此香，生於汝鼻，
it should
[]
be produced by
稱鼻所生，
and spread from it,
當從鼻出。
but since
[]
your nose is not
鼻非
sandalwood,
栴檀，
how can there be
云何
this fragrance there?
鼻中有栴檀氣。
If you say that
稱
you smell perfume,
汝聞香，
it should be
當於
inhaled into your nose,
鼻入。
but since
[]
it emanates from it
鼻中出香，
(as aforesaid),
[]
it is wrong to say that
@b@
you smell it.
說聞
@b@
非義。
If
若
it comes from the void,
生於空，
the latter being permanent,
空性常恒，
this fragrance
香
should be so as well
應常在，
and
[]
there would be no need to
何藉鑪中，
burn dry sandalwood.
爇此枯木。
If
若
it comes from the sandalwood,
生於木，
its fragrant substance
則此香質，
has become smoke by burning,
因爇成煙。
and
[]
if
若
your nose smells this perfume,
鼻得聞，
your nose should be full of smoke;
合蒙煙氣。
as smoke rises in the air,
其煙騰空，
how can it be smelt
@d@
@c@
未及遙遠，
in distant places
四十里內，
even before it reaches them?
@c@
@d@
云何已聞。
Therefore,
是故
you should know
當知，
that
[]
odour,
香
nose
鼻
and smelling
與聞，
have no fixed location
俱無處所。
and that
[]
smelling and odour
即嗅與香，
are false
二處虛妄。
being
本
neither causal
非因

緣，
nor self-existent. {98}
非自然性。

### Tongue & Taste

‘Ānanda,
阿難！
twice a day
汝常二時，
you go out to beg for food
眾中持砵，
and
[]
occasionally
其間或
are given butter and cream
遇酥酪醍醐，
which are
名為
tasty delicacies.
上味。
Do you think that
於意云何。
this taste
此味
comes from the void,
為復生於空中，
your tongue
生於舌中，
or the food?
為生食中。
Ānanda,
阿難！
if
若
it comes from your tongue,
復此味，生於汝舌，
the latter has already become butter, and
[]
since you have only one tongue,
在汝口中，祇有一舌，
[]
其舌爾時已成酥味，
how can you then
@a@
taste honey?
遇黑石蜜
@a@
應不推移。
If you do not,
若不變移，
this means that your taste does not change, then
[]
how can it be called
不名
tasting?
知味。
If it changes
若變移者，
and since
[]
your tongue is
舌
of one substance,
非多體，
how can this single tongue
@b@
know various tastes?
云何多味
@b@
一舌之知。
If it comes from the food,
若生於食，
the latter cannot know,
食非有識，
then
[]
how can
云何
it taste itself?
自知。
Assuming that
又食
it knows itself,
自知，
it and other food
即同他食，
will have nothing to do with
何預於汝，名
your tasting.
味之知。
If
若
it comes from the void,
生於空，
when you “bite” the air,
汝噉虛空，
what does it
當作
taste like?
何味。
Assuming that
必
it comes from the void,
其虛空若作鹹味，
when the latter tastes salt,
既鹹
as your tongue is salty,
汝舌，
your face
@c@
should be so too;
亦鹹
@c@
汝面，
if so
則
all men would be
此界人，
like fish in the sea.
同於海魚。
If you are salty,
既常受鹹，
you will not know
了不知
what is
[]
tasteless.
淡。
If
若
you do not know
不識
what is
[]
tasteless,
淡，
and
亦
do not taste salt,
不覺鹹。
you will have no taste;
必無所知，
then
[]
how can there be
云何名
taste?
味。
Therefore,
[]
you should know
是故當知，
that
[]
neither taste
味
nor tongue
舌
nor tasting
與嘗，
has location
俱無處所。
and that
[]
tasting
即嘗
and taste
與味，
are false
二俱虛妄。
being

neither causal

非自然性。

### Body & Touch

‘Ānanda,
阿難！
you are accustomed to
汝常
rub your head with your hand
@a@
every day early in the morning.
晨朝
@a@
以手摩頭。
[]
於意云何。
When feeling this rub,
此摩所知，
do you know
[]
whether that which rubs
誰為能觸，
is your hand
能為在手，
or your {99} head?
為復在頭。
If
若
it is your hand,
在於手，
then
[]
your head (an object) should not feel
頭則無知，
that it is being rubbed; if so
[]
how can there be
云何成
touch?
觸。
If
若
it is your head,
在於頭，
there would be
[]
no need for your hand
手則無用，
to rub it; then
[]
how can you call it
云何名
touch?
觸。
If
若
both hand and head are subjects,
各各有，
then
則
you,
汝
Ānanda,
阿難，
should have two bodies.
應有二身。
If it comes from the contact of
@b@
your hand with your head,
若頭與手
@b@
一觸所生，
then both
[]
your hand and head
則手與頭，
should be one,
當為一體。
and
[]
one thing
若一體者，
cannot contact itself.
觸則無成。
If it is two
若二體者，
(i.e. hand and head),
[]
from which does it arise,
觸誰為在。
for subject and object
在能非所，在所非能。
differ?
[]
Neither
不應
can there be touch
@c@
when your head comes into contact with
[]
the void.
虛空
@c@
與汝成觸。
Therefore,
[]
you should know
是故當知，
that
[]
neither the feeling of touch
覺觸
nor your body
與身，
has location
俱無處所。
and that they are false,
即身與觸，二俱虛妄。
being

neither causal
本非因
nor conditional
緣，
nor self-existent.
非自然性。

### Intellect & Dharma

‘Ānanda,
阿難！
[]
汝常意中。
because of
所緣
good,
善
evil
惡
and
[]
neutral causes,
無記

三性，
your intellect (manas) always

Are these dharma

created by the mind
即心所生，
or

do they exist apart from it
當離心，
and

have their own place?
別有方所。
Ānanda,
阿難！
if
若
they are
[]
the same as
即
the mind,
心者，
they cannot be
法則非
its objects

for they are not

its causal phenomena;

how can they

If they do,

they are merely

the mind;

they

If they have (the faculty of) knowing

your mind;

how can you

have {100} another mind
汝心，
as well as your own?
更二於汝。
If

## Fusing the Eighteen Fields or Realms of the Senses

‘Again,
復次
Ānanda,
阿難！
why are
云何
the eighteen fields or realms
十八界，
of the senses (the same as)
[]
the Absolute in the Tathāgata store?
本如來藏妙真如性。

### The Field of Sight-Perception

‘Ānanda,
阿難！
as you (already) know,
如汝所明，
eyes and form are causes
眼色為緣，
that beget sight-perception.
生於眼識。
Is this sight-perception
此識為復
created and conditioned by
[]
the eyes
因眼所生，
[]
以眼為界。
or by form?
因色所生，
[]
以色為界。

Ānanda,
阿難！
if it is created by the eyes,
若因眼生，
in the absence of both
既無
form
色
and
[]
the void,
空，
there will be nothing
無可
to be differentiated;
分別，
then
[]
what is the use of this perception
@a@
even if you own it?
縱有汝識，
@a@
欲將何用。
In this instance
[]
what you see will be neither
汝見又非
blue,
青
yellow,
黃
red
赤
nor
[]
white,
白，
[]
無所表示，
where then can you
從何
show its boundary?
立界。
If
若
it is created by form,
因色生，
when you see the void,
空
which means that
[]
form is {101} absent,
無色時，
your perception
汝識
should cease to exist;
應滅，
then
[]
why do you
云何
still
識知
distinguish the void?
是虛空性。
When form changes,
若色變時，
you notice
汝亦識其
it
色相遷變，
but your perception
汝識
is unchanging;
不遷，
then
[]
where can its boundary be?
界從何立。
If perception
[]
follows the change of form
從變
to undergo its own change,
則變，
there would be no boundary.
界相自無。
If it is unchanging,
不變
it should be permanent;
則恒。
then (as it is created by form)
既從色生，
it should not perceive the void.
應不識知虛空所在。
If it is created by both
若兼二種，
the eyes
眼
and form,
色
[]
共生，
合則
@b@
these two are separate
中離，
when (you think that they are) united
@b@
and
[]
unite (when you think that they are)
@c@
separate;
離則
@c@
兩合，
if so,
[]
both intermingle;
體性雜亂，
then
[]
how can
云何
there be the realm
成界。
of the eyes and that of form?
[]
Therefore,
[]
you should know
是故當知
that
[]
both causal eyes and form
眼色為緣，
as well as the (so-called)
[]
created perception
生眼識界，
do not exist,
三處都無。
and that
則
the eyes,
眼
form

and the realm of form
及色界三，
are
本
neither causal

nor conditional
緣，
nor self-existent.
非自然性。

### The Field of Sound-Perception

‘Ānanda,
阿難！
as you (already) know,
又汝所明，
ears and sound are causes
耳聲為緣，
that beget perception of sound.
生於耳識。
Is this perception
此識為復
created and conditioned
[]
by the ears
因耳所生，
[]
以耳為界。
or by sound?
因聲所生，
[]
以聲為界。

[]
阿難！
If it is created by the ears,
若因耳生，
this organ,
@a@
in the absence of both disturbance and stillness,
動靜二相，既不現前，
does not discern anything and is, therefore,
[]
@a@
根
devoid of objects;
不成知。
if it cannot discern,
必無所知，
[]
知尚無成，
how can it create perception? {102}
識何形貌。
Assuming that
若
hearing (begets) perception by the ears,
取耳聞，
since no hearing occurs in
@b@
the absence of both disturbance and stillness,
無動靜故，
@b@
聞無所成。
how can
云何
the ears (which are) form
耳形，
unite with external objects
雜色觸塵，
to produce perception
名為識界。
and where can the latter’s field be?
則耳識界，復從誰立。
If it is created by sound,
若生於聲，
that is
[]
if it depends (solely) on sound,
識因聲有，
then
[]
it should have no relation to your hearing.
則不關聞，
But
[]
if hearing ceases,
無聞
there will be no sound.
則亡聲相所在。
Now assuming that
[]
it is really
識從
created by sound
聲生，
and that
[]
sound exists
@c@
because of hearing,
許聲因聞
@c@
而有聲相，
then
[]
your hearing of sound
聞應
should be perceived by the ears.
聞識，
If this sound is not perceived,
不聞
it would have
[]
no relation with the realm
非界。
of ear-perception. (On the other hand)
[]
if it is heard,
聞則
it is already sound,
同聲。
and
[]
since it is hearing’s object,
識已被聞，
(it cannot discern anything);
[]
then
[]
who knows the perception?
誰知聞識。
If
若
there is no such knower,
無知者，
you will be like
終如
grass and plants.
草木。
There cannot be
不應
a mixing of
[]
sound and hearing
聲聞
to create
雜成
between them
[]
an intermediate realm
中界。
(of perception by the ear)
[]
for such a realm
界
cannot be at the center,
無中位，
in the inner organ,

or in the outer sound.
外相，
[]
復從何成。
Therefore
是故當知，
neither

exist as causes,

nor

perception by the ear
生耳識界，
(as effect)
[]

三處都
@d@
無。
and ears,
則耳

與聲，
and its field
及聲界三，
are
本
neither causal
非因
nor conditional,
緣，
nor self-existent.
非自然性。

### The Field of Smell-Perception

‘Ānanda,
阿難！
as you (already) know,
又汝所明，
the nose and smell are causes
鼻香為緣，
that beget the perception of smell.
生於鼻識。
Is this perception
此識為復
created and conditioned
[]
by the nose
因鼻所生，
[]
以鼻為界。
or by smell?
因香所生，
[]
以香為界。

If so,
[]
Ānanda,
阿難！
[]
若因鼻生，則汝心中，
what is this nose?
以何為鼻。
Is it
為
that hooked and fleshy part of your face
取肉形雙爪之相。
with which you sniff?
為取嗅知動搖之性。
But
[]
this piece of flesh {103}
若取肉形，
belongs to the body
肉質乃身，
and
[]
the body’s perception
身知
is called touch;
即觸，
the body is not the nose
名身非鼻，
and
[]
touch is its object.
名觸即塵。
If the nose cannot be named,
鼻尚無名，
where is it?
云何立界。
If it perceives smell,
若取嗅知，
where is that perception
@a@
in your mind?
又汝心中
@a@
以何為知。
If perception comes
@b@
from a part of the face,
以肉
@b@
為知，
it is touch
則肉之知，
and
[]
has nothing to do with the nose.
元觸非鼻。
If it comes from the void,
以空為知，
it should be known by the latter
空則自知，
instead of being felt by the flesh;
肉應非覺。
if so,
如是
the void should be you
則應虛空是汝，
and
[]
your body would
汝身
feel nothing.
非知。
Then,
今日
there would be
[]
no
@c@
Ānanda
阿難，
@c@
應無
anywhere
所在。
at the moment.
[]

‘If smell is the knower,
以香為知，
it should know itself
知自屬香，
and
[]
would have nothing to do with you.
何預於汝。
If good and bad smells
若香臭氣，
create your nose,
必生汝鼻，
they
則彼香臭二種流氣，
should not produce
不生
sandalwood and fetid herbs.
伊蘭。及栴檀木。
Without the latter,
二物不來，
smell your own nose
汝自嗅鼻，
and see if it is
[]
fragrant
為香
or
[]
offensive.
為臭。
Since fragrance cannot stink
臭則非香，
and
[]
stench cannot be fragrant,
香則非臭。
if
若
you can smell both,
香臭二俱能聞者，
you should have
則汝一人，應有
two noses,
兩鼻。
and
[]
now as you ask me
對我
about the Dharma,
問道，
there should be two Ānandas;
有二阿難，
then
[]
which Ānanda are you?
誰為汝體。
If
若
there is only one nose
鼻是一，
and
[]
if fragrance and stench
香臭
are not two different smells,
無二，
they can be
[]
mistaken for each other,
臭既為香，香復成臭。
which proves
[]
that neither exist;
二性不有，
if so
[]
where can the field of smell perception
界從
be established?
誰立。
If it is created by smell
若因香生，
and
[]
if perception exists
識因
because of smell,
香有。
it is like
如
your eyes
眼
which can see things,
有見，
but not themselves;
不能觀眼。
so that
[]
perception which exists
因香有故，
because of smell should not scent it.
應不知香。
If it does,
知
it cannot be created by smell,
即非生。
and
[]
if it does not,
不知
it is deprived of that perception.
非識。
Since
[]
smell
香
does not depend on perception,
非知有，
it has no field.
香界不成。
If perception cannot smell,
識不知香，
its field cannot be
因界則非
established on the basis of smell.
從香建立。
Since
[]
there is no {104}
既無
intermediate perception
中間，
(between nose and smell), there would be
[]
neither inner
不成內
(organ)
[]
nor outer
外。
(object).
[]
Thus smell-perception
彼諸聞性，
is false.
畢竟虛空。
Therefore,
是故當知，
neither
@a@
nose
鼻
nor
[]
smell, as causes,
香為緣，
nor
[]
the field of smell-perception,
生鼻識界，
as their creation,
[]
exist,
三處都
@a@
無。
while nose,
則鼻
smell
與香，
and its field
及香界三，
are
本
neither causal
非因
nor conditional,
緣，
nor self-existent.
非自然性。

### The Field of Taste-Perception

‘Ānanda,
阿難！
as you (already) know,
又汝所明，
tongue arid taste are causes
舌味為緣，
that beget perception by the tongue.
生於舌識。
Is this perception
此識為復
created and conditioned
[]
by the tongue,
因舌所生，
[]
以舌為界。
or by taste?
因味所生，
[]
以味為界。

‘Ānanda,
阿難！
if
若
it is created by the tongue,
因舌生，
then
則諸世間
sugar cane,
甘蔗、
sour black plums,
烏梅、
bitter wort,
黃連、
rock-salt,
石鹽、
wild spikenard,
細辛、
ginger
薑、
and
[]
cassia
桂、
would be tasteless.
都無有味。
Taste your own tongue
汝自嘗舌，
and see if
[]
it is
為
sweet or bitter.
甜為苦。
If it is bitter,
若舌性苦，
who is the taster?
誰來嘗舌。
Since
[]
the tongue
舌
cannot taste itself,
不自嘗，
who experiences the taste?
孰為知覺。
If it is not bitter,
舌性非苦，
no taste can come from it.
味自不生，
Then
[]
how can
云何
it be conditioned?
立界。

‘If
若
perception derives from taste,
因味生，
it would be taste itself
識自為味，
but,
[]
like the tongue,
同於舌根，
it cannot taste itself.
應不自嘗，
Then
[]
how can
云何
it distinguish various flavours?
識知是味非味。
Again, since
又
there are many flavours
一切味，
which
[]
cannot come from a single source,
非一物生。
there should be as many
味既多生，
(corresponding) perceptions.
識應多體。
If there is only one,
識體若一，
and
[]
if it is created by (different) flavours,
體必味生。
then
[]
all salt,
鹹
insipid,
淡
sweet
甘
and
[]
bitter
辛，
flavours
[]
should unite
和合俱生，
and
諸變異相，
become one;
同為一味，
then
[]
there would be no discerning.
應無分別。
If so,
分別既無，
there would be no perception
則不名識，
(by the tongue).
[]
How then can
云何復名
the tongue,
舌
taste
味
and {105}
[]
perception
識界。
be conditioned?
[]
The void cannot
不應虛空，
make your mind perceive.
生汝心識。
Since

tongue

taste
味

[]
cannot
@a@
unite
和合，
to create an intermediate (perception),
即於是中元
@a@
無
[]
自性，
where is the latter’s field?
云何界生。
Therefore,
是故當知，
tongue and taste, as causes,
舌味為緣，
and
[]
the field of taste-perception,
生舌識界，
as their creation,
[]
do not exist,
三處都無。
while tongue,
則舌

與味，
and their field of perception
及舌界三，
are
本
neither causal

nor self-existent.
非自然性。

### The Field of Touch-Perception

‘Ānanda,
阿難！
as you (already) know,
又汝所明，
body and touch are causes
身觸為緣，
that create
生於
the perception of touch.
身識。
Is this
此識為復
created and conditioned
[]
by the body
因身所生，
[]
以身為界。
or by touch?
因觸所生，
[]
以觸為界。

‘Ānanda,
阿難！
if it is created by the body,
若因身生，
what does the latter perceive
@a@
when
[]
there is neither
必無
contact nor separation?
合離
[]
二覺觀緣，
@a@
身何所識。
If by touch,
若因觸生，
your body would not be needed;
必無汝身，
then
[]
who can, without a body,
誰有非身
feel contact and separation?
知合離者。
Ānanda,
阿難！
objects do not perceive touch,
物不觸知，
but
[]
the body knows
身知
and feels it.
有觸。
Body’s perception
知身
is revealed by touch
即觸，
and
[]
touch through the body.
知觸即身。
Therefore,
[]
body and touch are inseparable
即觸非身，即身非觸。
but they are not the same
[]
and so
(身觸二相，)
originally
元
they have no home.
無處所。
When touch contacts body,
合身即為
it becomes the body,
身自體性。
and
[]
when it ceases,
離身即是
it becomes the void.
虛空等相。
Since
[]
there are no such things as
@a@
inner
內
(body) and

outer
外
(touch),
[]
@a@
不成，
how can there be
@b@
an intermediate
中云

[]
@b@
何立。
[]
中不復立，
Where then is the field of body-perception?
內外性空則汝識生，從誰立界。
Therefore,
是故當知，
body and touch, as causes,
身觸為緣，
and
[]
body-perception,
生身識界，
as their creation,
[]
do not exist,
三處都無。
and all three
則身與觸，及身界三，
are

neither causal

nor self-existent. {106}
非自然性。

### The Field of the Sixth Consciousness

‘Ānanda,
阿難！
as you (already) know,
又汝所明，
intellect (manas) and dharma (ideas) are causes
意法為緣，
that create the sixth consciousness.
生於意識。
Is this consciousness
此識為復

‘Ānanda,
阿難！
if this consciousness is created by intellect,
若因意生，
the latter

發明汝意。
In the absence of dharma,
若無前法，
your intellect

even if it does create consciousness,

what is the latter’s use

兼了別性，
are they the same as,
為同
or different from each other?
為異。
If the same,
同意
consciousness
[]
is just intellect;
即意，
then
[]
how can
云何
it be created by intellect?
所生。
If different,
異意不同，
consciousness
[]
would be “unconscious”;
應無所識。
[]
若無所識，
then
[]
how can
云何
it come from intellect?
意生。
If it is also “conscious” then
若有所識，
(tell me)
[]
what intellect and consciousness are.
云何識意。
Therefore they are
[]
neither the same nor different,
唯同與異，

二性無成，
then

where is the field of consciousness?

‘If consciousness is created by dharma,

For dharma

## Fusing the Seven Elements into the Absolute to Reveal the Free Intermingling of Phenomenon & Noumenon

Ānanda said to the Buddha:
阿難白佛言：
‘World Honoured One,
世尊。
the Tathāgata
如來
has often spoken of
常說
[]
和合
cause, condition
因緣，
and the state of the self as such

[]
all changes and transformations in the world
一切世間種種變化，
are due to
皆因
the mixture and fusion
@a@
of the four elements.
四大
@a@
和合
[]

Why does he now
云何如來，
wipe out all concepts of
@b@

and
[]
the state of the self as such?
略然，
@b@
二俱排擯。
I do not understand;

開示眾生，
all living beings the Mean
中道了義，
which is

戲論法。

爾時
The Buddha replied:
世尊，告阿難言：
‘You are tired of,

the Hīnayāna teaching on

### Exposing Faulty Differentiation

‘Ānanda,

@b@
則不能與諸大雜和。
just as
猶如
the void cannot with form.
虛空，不和諸色。
On the other hand,
[]
if they so mix and fuse
若和合者，
they are transformations and owe their existence
[]
wholly to their mutual dependence;
同於變化。
they are thus
[]
subject to
始終相成，
creation and destruction
生滅相續。
in endless succession,
生死死生，
[]
生生死死，
like the ring of fire
如旋火輪，
caused when a torch is waved in a circle.
(未有休息。)

### Pointing to the One Source

‘Ānanda,
阿難！
this is like
如
water which, after becoming ice,
水成冰，
can change back into water. {109}
冰還成水。

### The element of earth

‘Look at the element of earth
汝觀地，
which
[]
ranges in size
麤為
from the great earth
大地，
to a tiny speck of dust.
細為微塵。
Split this speck
至鄰
which is
[]
near to nothing
虛塵，
and
[]
reduce it
析彼
to the finest mote
極微色
on the extreme border of form.
邊際相，
[]
七分所成。
Then split it again
更析鄰虛，
and
[]
it becomes the void.
即實空性。
Ānanda,
阿難！
if this mote
若此鄰虛，
can be reduced to nothing,
析成虛空，
you should know that
當知
form comes from the void.
虛空，出生色相。

‘You now ask about
汝今問言，
material changes which
[]
you attribute to the mixing and uniting
由和合故，
(of the four elements).
出生世間諸變化相。
Take, for instance,
汝且觀
this mote which is nearest to the void;
此一鄰虛塵，
how much voidness
用幾虛空，
should be mixed and united
和合
to produce it?
而有。
But it is absurd to suppose that
[]
this can be done by uniting motes.
不應鄰虛，合成鄰虛。
Since a mote can be split
又鄰虛塵，
and reduced to voidness,
析入空者，
how many
用幾
(particles of)
[]
form
色相，
should be fused together
[]
to create the void?
合成虛空。
The union of form
若色合時，
(with form)
[]
produces form
合色
but not voidness,
非空。
and
[]
the union of the void
若空合時，
(with the void)
[]
produces voidness
合空
but not form.
非色。
Form can be split up
色猶可析，
but
[]
how can the void unite
空云何合。
(with form)?
[]

‘You do not know that
汝元不知，
in the Tathāgata store
如來藏中，
both form and the void
性色真空，性空真色，
arise from self-nature and are identical with each other, and that the element of earth
[]
is fundamentally pure and clean,
清淨本然，
embraces all
周遍
in the Dharma-realm {110}
法界。
and
[]
manifests
@a@
because the minds of living beings
隨眾生心，
know and distinguish
應所知量，

Ignorant wordlings
世間無知，
wrongly attribute this to
惑為
cause,
因
condition
緣，
and
及
the state of the self as such,
自然性。
because their consciousnesses
皆是識心，
differentiate and discriminate
分別計度。
without their knowing that
[]
the language they use
但有言說，
has no real meaning.
都無實義。

### The element of fire

‘Ānanda,
阿難！
fire has no ego
火性無我，
but
[]
exists because of
寄於諸
(external)
[]
causes.
緣。
When
(汝觀)
people in a town
城中
are about
[]
to prepare their meals,
未食之家，
they use mirrors of polished metal
欲炊爨時，手執陽燧。
to obtain fire from the sun.
日前求火。

‘Ānanda,
阿難！
about
名
(your idea of)
[]
mixture and union,
和合者，
take
如
this community of myself
我與汝，
and
[]
twelve hundred and fifty
一千二百五十
bhikṣus;
比丘，
[]
今為一眾。
though the group is one,
眾雖為一，
[]
詰其根本，
each member

Śāriputra
舍利弗，

婆羅門種。
Uruvilvā,
優樓頻螺，
a Kāśyapa tribesman,
迦葉波種。
and you,
乃至
Ānanda,
阿難，
who are of the Gautama clan.
瞿曇種姓。

‘Ānanda,
阿難！
if fire
若此火性，
comes
@a@
from

the mixture and fusion
和合
@a@
有。
(of the elements), when
[]
a man
彼

does this fire come

the moxa

Ānanda,
阿難！
if

it comes from the sun,
日來者，
it can burn
自能燒
the moxa in your hand;
汝手中之艾，
if so,
[]
all the trees
來處林木，

皆應受焚。
If
若
it comes {111}
[]
from the mirror
鏡中出，
and then
(自能於鏡，)
lights the moxa,
出然於艾。
why does it
[]
not melt the mirror
鏡何不鎔。

burn your hand?
紆汝手執，
But
[]
if you do not
尚無
even

feel the heat,
熱相，
how can

the mirror melt?
融泮。
If

it comes from the moxa,

why
何
does the latter

藉
the sun

然後火生。
Look at the mirror

鏡因手執，
the sun up in the sky
日從天來，
and
[]
the moxa
艾
which
[]
originally
本
came from the ground;
地生，
how can

fire

從何方

遊歷於此。
(Moreover)

### The element of water

‘Ānanda,
阿難！
water
水
is unstable by nature
性不定，
for it
[]
either flows or is still.
流息無恒。
Great magicians
@a@
in Śrāvastī,

是諸師等，
by exposing a crystal ball

承月中水，
Does
[]
this water
此水為復
come from the ball,
從珠中出，
the void
空中自有，
or the moon?
為從月來。
Ānanda,
阿難！
if it comes from the moon
若從月來，
which is a very long way off,
尚能遠方
it should pass through the trees in the forest before

reaching the crystal ball
令珠

出水，
[]
所經林木，
[]
皆應吐流。
[]
流則何待

方諸所出。
If it does not flow
不流，
through the trees, this shows that
[]
it does not
明水非
drop from the moon.
從月降。
If
若
it comes from the crystal ball,
從珠出，
it should
則此珠中，
flow regularly
常應流水，
not only when
何待
the moon is full.
中宵承白月晝。
If
若
it comes from the void of space
從空生，

it should

if so,
[]
how can
云何
there be
復有
living beings
水陸空行。
to walk on the earth, fly in the air and swim in the water?
[]
Think of all this again;
汝更諦觀，
the moon is
月從
in the sky,
天陟。
the crystal ball
珠
is in the man’s hand
因手持，
and
[]
the bowl is in front of him;

where does this water
水從何方，
come from to flow

The moon
月

the ball
珠
are a very long way apart
相遠，

It is absurd to say

### The element of wind

‘Ānanda,
阿難！
the element of wind
風性
has no substance
無體，
and
[]
either moves or is still.
動靜不常。
When you
汝常
join a gathering
@a@
and
[]
adjust your robe,
整衣
@a@
入於大眾，
the hem
僧伽梨角
(occasionally)
[]
brushes
動及
the person next you,
傍人，
disturbing the air which fans his face.
則有微風拂彼人面。
Does this wind
此風為復
come from the hem
出袈裟角，
of your robe,
[]
from the void
發於虛空，
or
[]
from that man’s face?
生彼人面。

‘Ānanda,
阿難！
if it
此風若
comes from
復出
the hem
袈裟角，
of your robe,
(汝乃披風，)
the latter
其衣飛搖，
should leave your body
應離汝體。
(to brush the man’s face). As
[]
I preach the Dharma here,
我今說法會中
my robe does not move;
垂衣。
where can you find any wind in it?
汝看我衣，風何所在，
It has no hidden place
不應衣中，
where wind can be stored.
有藏風地。

‘If the wind []
comes from the void,
若生虛空，
why does it not fan
@a@
(the man) when
[]
your robe is still?
汝衣不動，
@a@
何因無拂。
(Moreover)
[]
the void is permanent
空性常住，
and so should be the wind;
風應常生。
then without the wind
若無風時，
there would be no void.
虛空當滅。
You can feel when
[]
the wind stops fanning,
滅風可見，
but

what indication
@b@
can there be when

the void ceases to exist?
滅空
@b@
何狀。
If
若
the void

can be
有
created

destroyed,
滅，
it cannot (really) be
不名
void,
虛空。
and if it is,
名為虛空，
how can
云何
it create the wind?
風出。

‘If
若
the wind comes from your neighbour’s face,
風自生被拂之面，
it should also fan you;
從彼面生，當應拂汝。
then
[]
why does not your robe
@a@
when brushing against him
自汝整衣，

云何
fan you back?
倒拂。

‘Look into all this carefully.
汝審諦觀，
The robe which you adjust {114} is yours,

the void is still
虛空寂然，

### The element of space

‘Ānanda,
阿難！
space is
空性
[]
無形，因色顯發。
[]
如室羅城，
far from the river,
去河遙處，
people of different castes,

諸
Kṣatriya,

Brahman,

Vaiśya,

Śūdra,
首陀，

兼
Bhārad-vāja
頗羅墮，
and
[]
Caṇḍāla,
旃陀羅
who
等，
come to live there,
新立安居，
dig wells to find water.
鑿井求水。
Each foot of earth
出土一尺，
is replaced by
於中則有
a foot of space
一尺虛空。
and ten feet of earth
如是乃至出土一丈，
by ten feet of space,
中間還得一丈虛空。
so that
[]
the shallowness or depth
虛空淺深，
of each well
[]
corresponds with the amount
隨出多少，
of earth removed. Does
[]
this space come from the earth,
此空為當因土所出，
from the digging
因鑿所有，
or
[]
from itself as such? {115}
無因自生。

‘Ānanda,
阿難！
if space
若復此空，
exists of itself,
無因自生，
why before the digging
未鑿土前，
was it not unobstructed
何不無礙，
by the earth? Why was there
[]
only earth
唯見大地
without any space
迴無通達。
being seen there?

‘If space comes from the earth,
若因土出，
it should be

seen to enter the well

If only the earth is removed

因土而出。
If

is not excavated
無出
and (space) does not
[]
fill in the hole,
入，
both space and earth
則應空土
should be the same;
元無異因。
[]
無異則同，
then
[]
why is not space dug out
@a@
with the earth?
則土出時，
@a@
空何不出。

‘If space
若因
comes from the digging,
鑿出，
when the former
則鑿
is produced by the latter,
出空，
no earth should be removed.
應非出土。
If space does not
不因

@a@
when a man uses his hands
鑿從人手，

unaware of
不悟
the real (identity of)

the four elements
四大

You do not know

如來藏中，
Bodhi and (its opposite) {116} the void

arise from the self-nature and are

because the element of space is

Ignorant worldlings
世間無知，
attribute this to

and

### The element of perception

[]
阿難！
‘Perception knows nothing
見覺無知，
by itself and
[]
only manifests
@a@
through form and voidness.
因色空
@a@
有。
As you are now
如汝今者
in Jetavana park,
在祇陀林，
you see
[]
light by day
朝明
and
[]
darkness in the evening.
夕昏。
At night
設居中宵，
there is light when the moon shines
白月則光
and
[]
darkness when there is no moon.
黑月便暗。
This light and darkness
則明暗等，
are discerned by the seeing,
因見分析。
(but)
[]
is this seeing
此見
of the same nature
[]
as light,
為復與明
darkness
暗相，
and the void
并太虛空，
[]
為同一體，
or not;
為非
[]
一體。
Is it the same
或同
or different from them?
非同，
[]
或異非異。

‘Ānanda,
阿難，
if the seeing is
此見
of the same nature
[]
as light,
若復與明
darkness
與暗，
or the void;
及與虛空，
[]
元一體者。
(we come to this:)
[]
as light and darkness alternate,
則明與暗，
and
[]
when there is one the other disappears,
二體相亡。
then
[]
if the seeing is one with darkness,
暗時
it should vanish when there is light
無明，
and vice versa.
明時無暗。
As the seeing disappears in both cases,
若與暗一，明則見亡。必一於明，暗時當滅。
why are light and darkness still seen?
滅則云何，見明見暗。
As they differ,
若明暗殊，
it follows that
[]
the seeing
見
is beyond
無
creation
生
and
[]
annihilation:
滅，
if so,
[]
how can the seeing be
一云何成。
the same as light and darkness? {117}
[]

‘If the seeing
若此見精，
is not of the same nature
@a@
as light and darkness,
與暗與明，
@a@
非一體者。
try to find out what
[]
this seeing
汝
looks like
[]
apart from light,
離明
darkness
暗，
and the void,
及與虛空，
without which
分析見元，
there can be no seeing
作何形相。
[]
離明離暗，
[]
及離虛空，
[]
是見元
like
同，
the
[]
hair of a tortoise
龜毛
and the
[]
horns of a hare.
兔角。

‘As light,
明
darkness
暗
and the void
虛空，
differ,
三事俱異，
where can
從何
the seeing be?
立見。
As light and darkness
明暗
are in opposition,
相背，
how can
云何
the seeing equate
或同。
with them? If there is
[]
no seeing
@a@
without light, darkness and the void,
離三元
@a@
無，
how can
云何
it differ from them?
或異。

‘If you try to
[]
separate the void
分空
from the seeing,
分見，
you will not
本無
find their boundaries;
邊畔，
if so,
[]
why are
云何
they not the same thing?
非同。

When you see light and darkness,
見暗見明，
your seeing does not change;
性非遷改，
so
[]
why does it
云何
not differ from them?
非異。

‘If you look closely and minutely
汝更細審
into all this
微細審詳，
and
[]
examine it
審諦
again and again,
審觀，
you will find that
[]
light comes from the sun,
明從太陽，
darkness from the moonless night,
暗隨黑月，
clearance from space
通屬虛空，
and
[]
obstruction from the earth;
壅歸大地，
so
如是
where is the begetter of
@a@
this essence of seeing?
見精，
@a@
因何所出。
Since the

seeing can discern
見覺
whereas the
[]
void cannot,
空頑，
they can

neither mix

nor unite.
非合，
And we
[]
cannot say
不應
that

this essence of seeing
見精，
comes from nowhere.
無從自出。

‘You should know that
[]
perception by
若
seeing and hearing
見聞知，
which
[]
pervades all
性圓周遍，
and
[]
essentially
本
does not change,
不動搖。
and
(當知)
boundless unmoving space,
無邊不動虛空，

its moving

(counterparts as such) the elements of

wind –

all of which

are called

the six elements,
六大。

are
皆
the fundamental
@a@

@a@
Tathāgata store. {118}

阿難！
‘You are infatuated by nature

‘You do not know that
汝曾不知，
in the Tathāgata store
如來藏中，
self-natured seeing is basically
(性見覺明，)
the enlightened perception
(覺精明見，)
which is pure and clean,
(清淨本然，)
embraces all
周遍
in the Dharma-realm
法界。
and
[]
manifests because
@a@
the minds of living beings
隨眾
know and distinguish
生心，
(between things).
[]
@a@
應所知量。
Like seeing which

the whole Dharma-realm,
周法界。
hearing,
聽
smelling,
嗅
tasting

and

touching
觸覺
as well as the activities of

body and mind
觸覺知，
have wonderful virtues
妙德
which are
[]
bright and universal
瑩然，
and so
[]
[]
遍周法界。圓滿十虛。
are not in a given place or direction.
寧有方所，
They manifest
@b@
according to the laws of karma.
循業
@b@
發現。
But ignorant worldlings
世間無知，
think wrongly
惑為
that they are
[]
causal,
因
conditional
緣，
and due to
及
the self as such.
自然性。
Because of
[]
their consciousnesses
皆是識心，
they
[]
differentiate
分別
and
[]
discriminate
計度。
and do not know that
[]
their language
但有言說，
has no real meaning.
都無實義。

### The element of consciousness

‘Ānanda,
阿難！
consciousness
識性
has no origin
無源，
and is (an illusion)
[]
arising
@a@
from
因
the six organs
於六種根
and sense data.
塵妄
@a@
出。
Look at
汝今遍觀
this holy assembly
此會聖眾，
and
[]
turn round to see
用目循歷。
those present;
[]
your eyes are
其目周視，
like a mirror
但如鏡中，
which cannot discern
無別分析。
while your consciousness {119}
汝識於中
notices in turn the presence of
次第標指，
Mañjuśrī,
此是文殊，
Pūrṇamaitrā-yaṇīputra,
此富樓那，
Maudgalyāyana,
此目犍連，
Subhūti,
此須菩提，
Śāriputra
此舍利弗，
(etc.).
[]
Does this consciousness come
此識了知，
from perception,
為生於見，
form
為生於相，
or the void,
為生虛空，
or does it (emerge)
[]
suddenly without any cause?
為無所因，突然而出。

‘Ānanda,
阿難！
if your consciousness
若汝識性，
comes from
生於
your seeing,
見中，
then in the
[]
absence of
如無
light,
明
darkness,
暗
[]
及與
form
色
and the
[]
void,
空，
there will be
(四種必無，)
no seeing,
元無汝見，
and
[]
when there is no perception,
見性尚無，
how can
從何
it create consciousness?
發識。

‘If your consciousness
若汝識性，
comes from form –
生於相中，
that is not from perception,
不從見生，
then, when
[]
light and darkness are not seen,
既不見明，亦不見暗，
there are
(明暗不矚，)
neither form
即無色
nor the void;
空，
then
[]
how can non-existing form
彼相尚無，
create consciousness?
識從何發。

‘If
若
your consciousness comes from the void –
生於空，
that is
[]
neither from form
非相
nor perception,
非見，
the absence of perception
非見
means
[]
also that of discernment
無辨，
which implies
[]
the non-perception of
自不能知，
light,
明
darkness,
暗
form
色
and
[]
the void;
空，
and the
[]
absence of form
非相
is the end of
滅
all external causes;
緣，
how, then, can your
[]
seeing,
見
hearing,
聞
feeling
覺
and
[]
knowing
知，
occur?
無處安立。
Thus
[]
without form and perception,
處此二非，
consciousness which
[]
comes from the void
空則
simply does not exist.
同無，
(On the other hand),
[]
if it exists in the absence of objects,
有非同物。
(縱發汝識，)
[]
what can it discern?
欲何分別。

‘If
若
your consciousness suddenly emerges
@a@
without any cause,
無所因，
@a@
突然而出，
why cannot
何不
it discern the moon
@b@
in the daytime?
日中，
@b@
別識明月。

‘Now
[]
look closely and minutely
汝更細詳，
into all this;
微細詳審，
your seeing
見託汝睛，
(perception) depends on the pupils of your eyes
[]
meeting an external object
相推前境，
which “is” when there is form
可狀成有，
and “is not” when there is no form.
不相成無，
These are the four causes (i.e. the seeing, eyes, form and voidness) from which consciousness {120} arises,
[]
but which one of them
如是識緣，因何
creates consciousness?
所出。
Since
[]
consciousness is always moving
識動
(to differentiate)
見澄，
whereas perception is still (for it does not discriminate), they
[]
cannot mix
非和
and
[]
fuse together.
非合。
Your hearing,
聞聽
feeling
覺
and
[]
knowing
知，
are in the same category
亦復如是，
(as your seeing)
[]
but your consciousness
不應識緣，
should still have a source.
無從自出。

‘If
若
this consciousness
此識心，
comes from nothing,
本無所從。
you should know that
當知
perception
了別
(by means of)
[]
seeing,
見
hearing,
聞
feeling
覺
and knowing

pervades everywhere
圓滿湛然，
and comes not from any source.
性非從所。
Moreover with

space,

fire
火
and

wind
風，
they are called

the seven elements,
七大。
the natures

真圓融，
being
[]
but
皆
the untreated and unending
@a@
Tathāgata store.
如來藏，
@a@
本無生滅。

‘Ānanda,
阿難！
because
[]
your mind is unsettled,
汝心麤浮，
you do not realize
不悟
that
[]
the seeing
見
and hearing
聞，
that
[]
arouse consciousness,
發明了知，
come fundamentally from
本
the Tathāgata store.
如來藏。
You should look into
汝應觀
the consciousnesses inside the Six Entrances

neither the same

neither

For you do not realize that
汝元不知，
in the Tathāgata store
如來藏中，
self-natured consciousness

Ignorant worldlings

# Ānanda’s Understanding Expressed in his Gāthā

After listening to the Buddha’s profound instruction,
@a@
Ānanda and the assembly
爾時阿難，及諸大眾，
@a@
蒙佛如來，微妙開示，
realized that
[]
their bodies and minds
身心
were now free
蕩然，
from all obstructions.
得無罣礙。
Each understood that
是諸大眾，各各自知，
his self-mind pervaded
心遍
the ten directions
十方。
of space which
[]
he saw clearly
見十方空，
like a leaf
@b@
held in his own hand,
如觀手中
@b@
所持葉物。
and that
(一切世間)
all things were
諸所有物，
[]
皆即
the wondrous and bright fundamental Mind of
@c@
Bodhi.
菩提
@c@
妙明元心。
While
[]
his essence of Mind
心精遍圓，
embraced all and
含裏
contained the ten directions,
十方。
he looked back at
反觀
his own body given him by his parents,
父母，所生之身，
which was like
[]
a speck of dust dancing
@d@
[]
猶彼十方，
in the great void,
虛空之中，
@d@
吹一微塵，
sometimes visible
若存
and
[]
sometimes not,
若亡。
and
[]
like
如
@e@
湛巨海，
a bubble rising and falling aimlessly
流一浮漚，起滅無從。
in a boundless clear ocean.
@e@
After
[]
seeing all this clearly,
了然自知，
they all
[]
realized their fundamental, profound, permanent
獲本妙心，
and indestructible (self-) minds,
常住不滅。
and
[]
brought their palms together
@f@
to pay reverence to the Buddha
禮佛
@f@
合掌，
(thanking Him) for (showing them)
[]
what they had never seen before.
得未曾有。

Thereupon, Ānanda
於如來前，
praised the Buddha
@a@
in the following
[]
gāthā:
說偈
@a@
讚佛。

{gatha}
‘O thou serene, all powerful and unchanging Lord,
妙湛總持不動尊
Rare is your all-embracing supreme Śūraṅgama
首楞嚴王世希有
Which helps me to root out wrong thoughts that have been held for untold aeons
銷我億劫顛倒想
And teaches me how to realize Dharmakāya in an instant. {122}
不歷僧祇獲法身
May I now win the fruit and achieve enlightenment
願今得果成寶王
To save living beings countless as the Ganges‘ sands.
還度如是恒沙眾
To myriad Buddha-lands I now offer this mind profound.
將此深心奉塵剎
To repay my debt of gratitude for the grace of the Lord.
是則名為報佛恩
Humbly I now implore the World Honoured One to seal
伏請世尊為證明
My oath to re-enter the five turbid realms wherein
五濁惡世誓先入
If even one being fails to become a Buddha
如一眾生未成佛
I shall (at once) renounce all my claim to Nirvāṇa.
終不於此取泥洹
O Great Hero, the Mighty, the Compassionate One,
十雄大力大慈悲
May you also destroy my last secret delusion
希更審除微細惑
So that I soon attain to Bodhi Supreme,
令我早登無上覺
Sitting in bodhimaṇḍalas everywhere.
於十方界坐道場
The void to an end may come,
舜若多性可銷亡
But my firm mind will not flinch. {123}
爍迦羅心無動轉
{/gatha}

`);
