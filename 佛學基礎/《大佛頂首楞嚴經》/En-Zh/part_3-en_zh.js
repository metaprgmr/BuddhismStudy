## Simultaneous elimination of ‘is’ & ‘is not’ to reveal the Absolute Mind

‘Thus the (underlying) principle of
[]
the absolute Enlightened Mind of the Tathāgata store,
@a@
being
以是
identical with
俱即
and (including) both
[]
the mundane
世
and
[]
supramundane,
出世故。
@a@
即如來藏妙明心元，
is above “is”
離即
and
[]
“is not”
離非，
and
[]
beyond both identity
是即
and
[]
difference.
非即。

‘How
如何
therefore, can
[]
worldly beings
世間
of the three realms
三有眾生，
of existence
[]
and
及
in the supramundane
出世間
śrāvaka
聲聞
and
[]
pratyeka-buddha {138}
緣覺，
states
[]
[]
以所知心
fathom
測度
the Tathāgata‘s Supreme Bodhi
如來無上菩提，
and
[]
penetrate the Buddha-wisdom
@a@
by word and speech?
用世語言
@a@
入佛知見。
For instance
譬如
(though) a lute
琴瑟箜篌琵琶，
can
[]
make sweet melody,
雖有妙音，
it is
[]
useless
@b@
in the absence of skilful fingers;
若無妙指，
@b@
終不能發。
it is the same with
@c@
you and all living beings
汝與眾生，
@c@
亦復如是。
for although
[]
the True Mind of precious Bodhi
寶覺真心，
is complete within every man,
各各圓滿。
when
[]
I press my finger
如我按指，
on it,
[]
the Ocean Syrnbol
海印
radiates
發光。
but as soon as
[]
your mind moves,
汝暫舉心，
all troubles
塵勞
(kleśa)
[]
arise.
先起。
This is
[]
due to
由
your remissness in your search
不勤求
for Supreme Bodhi,
無上覺道，
in your delight
愛念
in Hīnayāna
小乘，
and your contentment
[]
with the little progress
得少
which you regard
[]
as complete.’
為足。

## The One Mind, Sudden Awakening & Realization

Pūrṇamaitrāyaṇīputra
富樓那
said:
言：
‘The Buddha and I
我與如來
possess
[]
the true, absolute and clean Minds
@a@
of Complete Enlightenment
寶覺圓明，
@a@
真妙淨心，
which are
[]
the same and wholly perfect,
無二圓滿。
but why,
[]
after so many transmigrations
@b@
due to my delusion
而我昔遭
from the time without beginning
無始妄想，
@b@
久在輪迴。
and
[]
after my present attainment
今得
of the Saintly Vehicle,
聖乘，
am I still
[]
unable to
猶未
realize the Ultimate
究竟。
whereas
[]
the World Honoured One
世尊，
has eliminated
諸妄
all falseness
一切圓滅，
and
[]
has realized
獨
absolute permanence?
妙真常。
I beg to
[]
ask the Tathāgata
敢問如來，
[]
一切眾生
what causes the delusion
何因有妄，
that
[]
screens
自蔽
living beings from
[]
their profound {139} enlightenment
妙明，
and so
[]
subjects them to
受此
their present perdition.’
淪溺。

The Buddha replied:
佛告富樓那。
‘Although you
汝雖
have wiped out
除
your troubles (kleśa),
疑，
traces of your defilement
餘惑
still remain.
未盡。
I will now
吾以
put some worldly questions
世間現前諸事，
to you.
今復問汝。
Have you not heard of
汝豈不聞
(the mad man)
[]
Yajñadatta of Srāvastī
室羅城中，演若達多。
who would
忽於晨朝
look into a mirror
以鏡照面，
and
[]
delight in seeing
愛鏡中
his eyebrows and eyes
頭眉目可見。
but when one morning
[]
he failed to see them
@a@
in his own head,
瞋責己頭
@a@
不見面目。
thought
以為
himself bedevilled?
魑魅無狀狂走。
Do you think
於意云何，
there was
[]
any valid reason
此人何因
for such madness.
無故狂走。

Pūrṇamaitrāyaṇīputra
富樓那
replied:
言：
‘There was no valid reason.’
是人心狂，更無他故。

The Buddha
佛
said:
言：
‘The Absolute Bodhi
妙覺明圓，
is basically enlightened and absolute.
本圓明妙，
When
既
it is (screened and wrongly)
[]
called false,
稱為妄，
how can
云何
there be
[]
a REAL cause
有因。
(of) this delusion? For
[]
if
若
there is
有
a REAL reason,
所因，
how can
云何
it be called
名
FALSE?
妄。
All this arises
自諸
from wrong thinking
妄想，
which
[]
develops into
展轉
further wrong thinking.
相因。
When
[]
one falseness
從迷
is heaped
積迷，
on another,
[]
in spite of
@a@
the teachings by Buddhas
@a@
in countless former aeons,
以歷塵劫。
@a@
雖佛發明，
you are still
[]
unable to
猶不能
avoid delusion.
返。
Its causes
如是迷因，
are also under delusion,
因迷自有。
but
[]
if you realize that it has none,
識迷無因，
falseness will have no support
妄無所依。
(and will vanish).
[]
Since (delusion)
[]
was never created,
尚無有生，
what is there to destroy
欲何為滅。
to realize Bodhi?
[]

‘This is
得菩提者，
like
如
a man who, when awake,
寤時人
relates
說
what he saw in a dream;
夢中事。
he may be ingenious
心縱精明，
but
(欲何因緣)
what can he get
取夢中物。
from it? Still less can he benefit from a state which
[]
does not derive from any cause
況復無因，
and
[]
does not really exist,
本無所有。
like Yajñadatta who,
如彼城中演若達多，
without reason,
豈有因緣
took fright at
自怖
not seeing his own head.
頭走。
If he suddenly
忽然
ceased to be crazy,
狂歇，
his head
頭
would not
非
come from elsewhere,
外得。
and even
[]
if
縱
he was still mad,
未歇狂，
it was not
亦何
really lost. {140}
遺失。
Pūrṇamaitrāyaṇīputra,
富樓那。
since this is
[]
the nature of falseness
妄性如是，
where is its cause?
因何為在。
If you will only
汝但
cease to discriminate
不隨分別
and to believe in the (three illusions that there are)
[]
the universe,
世間，
karmic retribution
業果，
and (the realms of)
[]
living beings,
眾生
the three conditions
三種相續。
(derived from killing, stealing and carnality) will come to an end.
[]
Without these conditions,
三緣斷故，
the three causes
三因
will not arise
不生。
and,
[]
as with mad Yajñadatta;
則汝心中演若達多
the mad nature of your own mind
狂性
will come to an end
自歇，
and
[]
when it does,
歇
that is
即
Enlightenment (Bodhi).
菩提。
Thus
[]
your unexcelled, pure and enlightened
勝淨明
Mind
心，
which
[]
essentially
本
pervades
周
the Dharma realm,
法界。
does not come
不從
from outside;
人得。
how can
何藉
it be realized by
[]
toilsome
劬勞、
and
[]
profound practice
肯綮、
and
[]
by achievement?
修證。
This is like
譬如
a man
有人
with a cintāmaṇi pearl sewn
@a@
in his coat
於自衣中
@a@
繫如意珠，
who
[]
forgets all about it,
不自覺知。
thinks he is really poor
窮露他方，
and
[]
wanders about
@b@
begging for food.
乞食
@b@
馳走。
Although
雖
he is poor,
實貧窮，
his pearl
珠
has never been lost.
不曾失。
If
[]
a wise man suddenly
忽有智者
tells him
指示
that
其珠。
it is in his coat, all
[]
his wishes
所願
will be answered
從心，
and
[]
he will become very rich.
致大饒富。
He will
[]
thus realize
方悟
that
[]
his wonderful gem
神珠
does not come
非從
from outside.‘ {141}
外得。

Ānanda then
即時阿難
came forward,
在大眾中，
prostrated himself with his head
頂禮
at the feet of the Buddha,
佛足，
stood up
起立
and asked:
白佛。
‘The World Honoured One
世尊
now speaks of
現說
eliminating the three conditions of
@a@
killing,
殺
stealing
盜
and
[]
carnality
婬
@a@
業，三緣斷故，
to ensure that
[]
the three basic causes
三因
do not arise
不生。
and so
[]
to stop the upsurge of
@a@
Yajñadatta‘s madness
心中達多狂性
@a@
自歇。
and
[]
realize Bodhi
歇即菩提，
which thus
[]
does not come
不從
from outside.
人得。
This
斯則
without a shadow of doubt shows
@b@
the causes
因
and conditions
緣
@b@
皎然明白。
but
[]
why does
云何
the Tathāgata
如來
throw them away completely?
頓棄因緣。
It is also
[]
due to
我從
causes
因
and
[]
conditions
緣
that
[]
my mind has opened.
心得開悟。
World Honoured One,
世尊。
I am not the only śrāvaka
此義何獨我等
who, though still
[]
needing study and learning,
年少有學聲聞。
has so awakened, but
[]
others in this assembly,
今此會中
like
[]
Mahā-maudgalyāyana,
大目犍連
Śāriputra,
及舍利弗
Subhūti,
須菩提
etc.,
等，
who
[]
followed
從
the Brahmacārin,
老梵志
heard of
聞
the Buddha‘s teaching
佛
on causes and conditions,
因緣，
then
[]
awakened to the Dharma
發心開悟
and
[]
achieved the state
得成
beyond transmigration.
無漏。
If you now
[]
say that
今說
Bodhi
菩提
does not depend on
不從
causes
因
and
[]
conditions,
緣。
then
則
the self-existent as preached
@c@
by the heretics
[]
in Rājagṛha,
王舍城
such as
[]
Maskari
拘舍梨
Gośālī-putra
[]
and others,
等，
@c@
所說自然
would be Nirvāṇa.
成第一義。
Will you be so compassionate enough
惟垂大悲，
to enlighten my
開發
delusion
迷
and
[]
perplexity?’
悶。

The Buddha said: ‘Ānanda,
佛告阿難。
in the case of
即如城中
Yajñadatta,
演若達多，
if the (so-called)
[]
狂性
@a@
cause
因
and
[]
condition
緣，
of his madness
@a@
had been wiped out,
若得滅除。
his own nature
[]
which was not mad
則不狂性
would have revealed itself,
自然而出。
and whatever you may rationalize about
[]
cause,
因
condition
緣
and
[]
self-existence
自然，
does not go
理窮
beyond this. {142}
於是。

‘Ānanda,
阿難。
if Yajñadatta‘s head
演若達多，頭
had basically been
[]
self-existent,
本自然。
it should
[]
always have been so
本自其然，
and
[]
could not have been otherwise.
無然非自。
What then were the
何
cause
因
and
[]
condition
緣
that
故，
resulted in
[]
his taking fright
怖頭
and
[]
going mad?
狂走。

‘If his self-existent head
若自然頭
became mad owing to
@a@
cause
因
and
[]
condition,
緣
@a@
故狂。
[]
何不自然因緣故失。
why was it not lost?
本頭不失，
But when he
[]
took fright
狂怖
and went mad,
妄出。
why
曾
was it still there
[]
unchanged?
無變易，
Thus
[]
how could
何藉
cause
因
and
[]
condition
緣。
affect his head?
[]

‘If
[]
his madness was
本狂
self-existent,
自然，
it should
[]
always have been
本有
there
狂怖。
but
[]
before he became mad,
未狂之際，
where was it hidden?
狂何所潛。
‘If his madness
[]
was not
不狂
self-existent
自然，
and there was nothing seriously
[]
wrong with his head,
頭本無妄，
why did he go mad?
何為狂走。

‘If you realize that
若悟
his fundamental head
本頭，
(was intact), you will know that (only)
[]
his Consciousness
識知
became mad
狂走，
and will realize that to talk of
[]
cause,
因
condition
緣
and
[]
self-existence
自然，
is frivolous.
俱為戲論。

‘This is why
是故
I say that
我言
if the three conditions
三緣
(of killing, stealing and carnality)
[]
are eliminated,
斷故，
this is
即
Bodhi Mind.
菩提心。
(But the idea that)
[]
Bodhi Mind
菩提心
is created
生，
after
[]
the samsaric mind
生滅心
has been annihilated
滅，
pertains to saṃsāra.
此但生滅。

‘Even after the ideas of
[]
both creation
滅
and
[]
destruction
生
have been abandoned,
俱盡，
with
[]
no more thought of practice
無功
and {143} realization,
用道。
if the (least belief in)

self-existence
若有自然，

this shows clearly
如是則明，
that
[]
the death of the worldly
(自然心生，)
has given birth to
(生滅心滅，)
the self-existent mind
(此亦生滅。)
which also pertains
[]
to saṃsāra with its implied opposite,
無生滅者，
self-existence.
名為自然。
This is like
猶如
the mixture and fusion of
@a@
various worldly materials
世間諸相
@a@
雜和，
into a composite compound
成一體者，

名和合性。
which implies its opposite, the uncompounded.
非和合者，(稱本然性。)
(But) the Absolute which is

neither original

neither apart
